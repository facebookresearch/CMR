Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...  May I submit for inclusion, Your Honour, this most British of all lawyers...  This proud, this defiant Old Bailey Hack...  With his best gal, Hilda, She Who Must Be Obeyed, standing, NOT amused, by his side...  The one, the only...  HORACE RUMPOLE.  May there always be an England, and may there always be Horace Rumpole to see that justice be done. And thev pompous may squirm.

In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty .

Recipients of this award may add G.C. after their names; the cross ranks second only to the Victoria Cross (the highest British military decoration). The cross is silver, with one side depicting St. George slaying the dragon and with the inscription “For Gallantry;” the other side gives the recipient’s name and the date of the award.  The George Medal, instituted at the same time as the George Cross, is analogous to it but is awarded for services not quite so outstanding as those which merit the George Cross. Recipients of this medal can add G.M. after their names. The medal is silver; one side has the effigy of the reigning British monarch, and the other side has St. George and the dragon with the inscription “The George Medal.”  Learn More in these related articles:  George Cross - stephen-stratford.co.ukGeorge Cross  Home  - UK Medals - Gallantry - The George Cross  Introduction  This section  deals with various people who have been awarded The George Cross (GC)  Medal for bravery.  It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.

The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins , by activating digestive enzymes , and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids . Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach , which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed . Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic . These cells also produce mucus , which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach . The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract . | Question: where is hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach ?', ['cells in the lining of the stomach'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-50859'), ("Context: Following Albus Dumbledore 's death , Voldemort consolidates his support and power , including covert control of the Ministry of Magic , while Harry is about to turn seventeen , losing the protection of his home .

While Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory , he is not as credited for his attributions toward it . In 1839 , Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells . He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside . However , this was not an original idea of Schleiden . He claimed this theory as his own , though Barthelemy Dumortier had stated it years before him . This crystallization process is no longer accepted with modern cell theory . In 1839 , Theodor Schwann states that along with plants , animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures . This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants .

Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy ( the First Estate ) , nobles ( the Second Estate ) , and peasants and bourgeoisie ( the Third Estate ) . In some regions , notably Scandinavia and Russia , burghers ( the urban merchant class ) and rural commoners were split into separate estates , creating a four - estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate . Furthermore , the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates , leaving them without political rights . In England , a two - estate system evolved that combined nobility and bishops into one lordly estate with `` commons '' as the second estate .

The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline ( FAD ) hypothesis . The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability . However , FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines . Based on the studies of some recent famines , the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability . According to this view , famines are a result of entitlements , the theory being proposed is called the `` failure of exchange entitlements '' or FEE . A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs . The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two . These entitlements are called trade - based or production - based entitlements . Per this proposed view , famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements . An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement , i.e. , labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated . | Question: what is one of the main causes for famine in the world today ?", ['a decline in food availability'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-39508'), ('Context: Such coatings can reduce the reflection for ordinary glass from about 4 % per surface to around 2 % .

By 1973 , the use of fitted seat belts by vehicle occupants was made compulsory for the rest of Australia and some other countries during the 1970s and 1980s . The subsequent dramatic decline in road deaths is generally because of seat belt laws and subsequent road safety campaigns .

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ("Context: Income inequality in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s after several decades of stability , meaning the share of the nation 's income received by higher income households has increased .

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ("Context: `` Eye of the Tiger '' is a song composed by American rock band Survivor .

The members of the order strive to cultivate the ideals of the order’s founder. The Franciscans actually consist of three orders. The First Order comprises priests and lay brothers who have sworn to lead a life of prayer, preaching, and penance. This First Order is divided into three independent branches: the Friars Minor (O.F.M.), the Friars Minor Conventual (O.F.M. Conv.), and the Friars Minor Capuchin (O.F.M. Cap.). The Second Order consists of cloistered nuns who belong to the Order of St. Clare (O.S.C.) and are known as Poor Clares (P.C.). The Third Order consists of religious and lay men and women who try to emulate Saint Francis’ spirit by performing works of teaching, charity, and social service. Strictly speaking, the latter order consists of the Third Order Secular , whose lay members live in the world without vows; and the Third Order Regular, whose members live in religious communities under vow. Congregations of these religious men and women are numerous all over the Roman Catholic world. The Franciscans are the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic church. They have contributed six popes to the church.  It was probably in 1207 that Francis felt the call to a life of preaching, penance, and total poverty. He was soon joined by his first followers, to whom he gave a short and simple rule of life. In 1209 he and 11 of his followers journeyed to Rome, where Francis received approval of his rule from Pope Innocent III . Under this rule, Franciscan friars could own no possessions of any kind, either individually or communally (i.e., as the property of the order as a whole). The friars wandered and preached among the people, helping the poor and the sick. They supported themselves by working and by begging food, but they were forbidden to accept money either as payment for work or as alms. The Franciscans worked at first in Umbria and then in the rest of Italy and abroad. The impact of these street preachers and especially of their founder was immense, so that within 10 years they numbered 5,000. Affiliated with them were the Franciscan nuns, whose order was founded at Assisi in 1212, by St. Clare , who was under the guidance of St. Francis. Clare and her followers were lodged by Francis in the Church of San Damiano, where they lived a severe life of total poverty. They later became known as the Poor Clares or the Order of St. Clare.  Similar Topics  Cistercian  During the first years of the Franciscans, the example of Francis provided their real rule of life, but, as the order grew, it became clear that a revised rule was necessary. After preparing a rule in 1221 that was found too strict, Francis, with the help of several legal scholars, unwillingly composed the more restrained final rule in 1223. This rule was approved by Pope Honorius III .  Even before the death of Francis in 1226, conflicts had developed within the order over the observance of the vow of complete poverty . The rapid expansion of the order’s membership had created a need for settled monastic houses, but it was impossible to justify these if Francis’ rule of complete poverty was followed strictly. Three parties gradually appeared: the Zealots , who insisted on a literal observance of the primitive rule of poverty affecting communal as well as personal poverty; the Laxists, who favoured many mitigations; and the Moderates, or the Community , who wanted a legal structure that would permit some form of communal possessions. Something of an equilibrium was reached between these different schools of thought while St. Bonaventure was minister general (1257–74). Sometimes called the second founder of the order, he provided a wise, moderate interpretation of the rule. During this period the friars spread throughout Europe, while missionaries penetrated Syria and Africa. Simultaneously, the friars’ houses in university towns such as Paris and Oxford were transformed into schools of theology that rapidly became among the most celebrated in | Question: The religious order of Poor Ladies of San Damiano has what more common name?', ['order of poor ladies', 'poor clares'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5304'), ('Context: Since 1850 , only seven tropical cyclones have brought gale - force winds to the Southwestern United States .

B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY     1900  •S     Anthony van Dyck.      aking into consideration the intellectual life of the  Flemish and of the Dutch in general, the painters are  undoubtedly the most gifted of our countrymen. The  taste for Art was most lavishly bestowed upon them,  they have been the creating genius of our race, men with  keener eyes and more subtle feeling and with a hand more cunning  than the majority of their "fellow countrymen. They have been  instrumental in bringing the people of the low-lying countries to the  fore, causing them to rank amongst the highest in the Ideal world.  Now the most poetical of these painters was Anthony van Dyck, that is  to say if one understands by that word « poetical » a certain suscep-  tibility for impressions, and an inclination to be touched by emotions,  as may be termed sorrowful, suffering and tender.   Van Dyck was endowed with more feeling than strength, he  offered apparently but little resistance to the influence of others, yet  his natural disposition and his fine artistic taste were not submerged  by the powerful impression made on him by his illustrious prede-  cessors. These impressions, it may be said, he outgrew rather than  threw off, and drifted unconsciously into an independence which  ripened and matured through the increasing power of his matchless  talent. Born in Antwerp, of the bluest blood, he loved his native town  and with true artistic feeling was carried away and enraptured by  all that may be called beautiful, brilliant and glowing ; he surpassed  all others by the sensibility of his character, by the distinction of his  style, by his power to charm and by his love of the eminent. The  tender graceful sensitiveness of his nature made him a striking contrast  to and a protest against that boorishness and sluggishness, which are  considered by some the characteristics of our nation.   Such van Dyck appears to us as artist when we take a broad and     impartial view of him, but upon a nearer acquaintance his talents  become more sharply defined, especially when viewed by the glimpses  we get of his life and from a closer examination of his work.   So too he appears to us as a man : of noble exterior, conscious of  his own worth, speaking by the spirit that vibrates through his whole  being and which overshadows his surroundings through the charm  of his personality.

As you arrive at the Rascasse hairpin you find yourself at the start of the Paddock area.  At night you can visit the Stars 'n' Bars with the Palace and Historic Old Town perched above you on the Rock.  On the far side of the Rock is the New Town of Fontvieille, where a number of F1 old and New drivers live.  The Circuit:  Monaco is unique, and to many the annual blast round the streets of the tiny principality represents the jewel in the crown of Formula One. With its legendary casino and countless rows of millionaires' yachts in the harbour, Monaco is a glamorous place that lies at the very heart of the jet-set. It is also unique in that for many of the drivers the race is run on their doorstep, with the same streets they use for a daily trip to the newsagents, transformed into a race track.  Winding through the streets it is a circuit that has remained remarkably unchanged since the first race was staged in 1929. Before the war the circuit was witness to several great battles, with the legendary Tazio Nuvolari often among the winners. When World Championship racing began in 1950 Monaco played host to the second race, just a week after the first round at Silverstone. That race resulted in a massive pile-up on the very first lap and provided Fangio with his first ever championship victory. Since then the race has been plagued by a high attrition rate that has thrown up some unusual victories over the years. The combination of narrow roads, high kerbs and the close proximity of some unforgiving crash barriers, many a great driver has suffered at the hands of a track that quickly punishes the slightest error in judgement.  One memorable race came in 1955, the year that is best remembered for Alberto Ascari's trip into the harbour, a feat that was later emulated by the Australian driver Paul Hawkins. Both men survived their dunking although a number of driver's have not been so lucky. Luigi Fagioli was killed in a sports car race here in 1952 and Lorenzo Bandini was burned to death in 1967. Other driver's have far happier memories of the place. Graham Hill, for years known as 'Mister Monaco', won here five times. A record he held until the arrival of Ayrton Senna.

After an initially modest public reception , the oratorio gained in popularity , eventually becoming one of the best - known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music . | Question: the most famous oratorio in the world is messiah written by ?', ['Charles Jennens'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-39378'), ("Context: A Pacific Fleet was created in 1907 when the Asiatic Squadron and the Pacific Squadron were combined . In 1910 , the ships of the First Squadron were organized back into a separate Asiatic Fleet . The General Order 94 of 6 December 1922 organized the United States Fleet , with the Battle Fleet as the Pacific presence . Until May 1940 , the Battle Fleet was stationed on the west coast of the United States ( primarily at San Diego ) . During the summer of that year , as part of the U.S. response to Japanese expansionism , it was instructed to take an `` advanced '' position at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . Long term basing at Pearl Harbor was so strongly opposed by the commander , Admiral James O. Richardson , that he personally protested in Washington . Political considerations were thought sufficiently important that he was relieved by Admiral Husband E. Kimmel , who was in command at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor . | Question: when was the pacific fleet moved to pearl harbor ?", ['1940'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-67684')]

This article , Article 231 , later became known as the War Guilt clause . The treaty forced Germany to disarm , make substantial territorial concessions , and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers . In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion marks ( then $31.4 billion or £ 6.6 billion , roughly equivalent to US $442 billion or UK £ 284 billion in 2018 ) . At the time economists , notably John Maynard Keynes ( a British delegate to the Paris Peace Conference ) , predicted that the treaty was too harsh -- a `` Carthaginian peace '' -- and said the reparations figure was excessive and counter-productive , views that , since then , have been the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists from several countries . On the other hand , prominent figures on the Allied side such as French Marshal Ferdinand Foch criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently . | Question: explain three things that the allies demanded that germany do as part of the peace treaty ?", ['pay reparations', 'disarm', 'make substantial territorial concessions'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-23528'), ("Context: `` Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness '' is a well - known phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence . The phrase gives three examples of the `` unalienable rights '' which the Declaration says have been given to all human beings by their Creator , and which governments are created to protect . | Question: what rights are included in the declaration of independence ?", ['Liberty', 'the pursuit of Happiness', 'Life'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-86874'), ("Context: Originally entitled `` For Evermore '' , `` Evermore '' was written by composer Menken and lyricist Rice . The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ? '' Replacing `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' with `` Evermore '' helped make the songwriters eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song . | Question: who sang for dan stevens in beauty and the beast ?", ['Dan Stevens'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-17258'), ("Context: The first Chick - fil - A opened in 1967 , in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall , in a suburb of Atlanta .

The first freestanding franchise was opened April 16 , 1986 , on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta , Georgia , and the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type . Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base , most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

In the book By the Time We Got to Woodstock: The Great Rock \'n\' Roll Revolution of 1969 , Bruce Pollock writes:  Among the many people calling the publisher in 1968 for a lock of Hair\'s mystique was the L.A. producer Bones Howe, who\'d been working with the 5th Dimension since engineering " Up-Up and Away " for their first album in 1967. He\'d produced hits for the Turtles (" It Ain\'t Me Babe ") and the Association (" Windy "); he\'d been a personal guest of Lou Adler at the Monterey Pop Festival where he was perhaps the only West Coast guy in attendance to appreciate Laura Nyro\'s gruesome performance. Later he delivered Laura\'s "Stoned Soul Picnic" to the 5th Dimension, for which it was their biggest r&b hit. He was shuttling back and forth between his home in L.A. and the studio in New York working on the vocals for the Stoned Soul Picnic album when the group told him they wanted to do "Aquarius."  "The thing that bothered me about it was that there\'d been other releases of \'Aquarius,\'" said Bones, "and none had done anything, so I was concerned about what we would do that would be any different. I went to see the show and there\'s a place where they do "The Flesh Failures" and at the end of the song is just a three bar repeated thing of \'Let the sunshine in\' where Ragni was swinging across the stage on a chandelier and there was all kinds of craziness going on. That really stayed with me and I came out of the theater saying, I wonder if I could stick that on the end of \'Aquarius\' and make that the ending. So I went back to the hotel and I called the publisher. I mean you don\'t mess with the music from a Broadway show. I started my professional career in 1956 and I knew a lot about what you can and what you can\'t do with songs. I said, look the 5th Dimension would like to record \'Aquarius,\' but I\'d like to make it a medley and I\'d like to use the last three bars of \'The Flesh Failures\' and I don\'t want to do it without permission. So he said okay, you can go ahead and do it."  The next problem was to go ahead and do it. "The record was plotted in the fall of \'68 and more or less finished in January of \'69," Bones said. "I had to do a lot of work with my vocal arranger, Bob Alsivar. Because they couldn\'t sing both songs in the same key, we had to do a modulation; we figured out how I was going to do the instrumental arrangement so we could change keys. The record itself is the result of a conglomeration of things. I began as a jazz musician and I know the standard repertoire pretty well. I kept thinking about a song called \'Lost in the Stars\' and trying to find something to give you that kind of impression. I described it to Bill Holman and he wrote that beautiful woodwinds and strings part that\'s in the intro. We did the track in L.A. and the vocals in Las Vegas where the 5th Dimension were opening for Frank Sinatra. We were working in that studio in Las Vegas where you used to have to stop when the train went by. Once when we were doing practice runs while the train passed Billy started that riff at the end \'oh let the sunshine…\' so I said, wait, let me put that on a separate track at the end.

The right to property was a crucial demand in early quests for political freedom and equality , and against feudal control of property . Property can serve as the basis for the entitlements that ensure the realisation of the right to an adequate standard of living and it was only property owners which were initially granted civil and political rights , such as the right to vote . Because not everybody is a property owner , the right to work was enshrined to allow everybody to attain an adequate standard of living . Today discrimination on the basis of property ownership is recognised as a serious threat to the equal enjoyment of human rights by all and non-discrimination clauses in international human rights instruments frequently include property as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited ( see the right to equality before the law ) . | Question: who started the slogan of right to work in france ?", ['Louis Blanc'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-53195'), ('Context: The Suez Canal ( Arabic : قناة السويس \u200e \u200e qanāt as - suwēs ) is an artificial sea - level waterway in Egypt , connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez .

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule. The United States joined the war on the side of South     Vietnam in 1961, but withdrew combat troops in 1973. In 1975 North Vietnam     succeeded in taking control of South Vietnam.

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ('Context: All Dogs Go to Heaven is a 1989 animated musical comedy - drama film directed and produced by Don Bluth , and released by United Artists and Goldcrest Films .

Soprano Susan Bullock, who sings the central role of Queen Elizabeth in a new production, on Britten\'s unjustly neglected opera  Susan Bullock, second from right, as Queen Elizabeth l in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, London. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian.  Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone.

Thereafter , licenses were given to D'Arcy Exploration Company and Whitehall Petroleum but neither company found oil of commercial value and they returned their licenses in 1923 . A new license covering 920,000 square kilometres ( 357,000 square miles ) was given to Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria , a consortium of Shell and British Petroleum ( then known as Anglo - Iranian ) . The company began exploratory work in 1937 . The consortium was granted license to explore oil all over the territory of Nigeria but the acreage allotted to the company in the original license was reduced in 1951 and then between 1955 and 1957 . Drilling activities started in 1951 with the first test well drilled in Owerri area . Oil was discovered in non-commercial quantities at Akata , near Eket in 1953 . Prior to the Akata find , the company had spent around 6 million pounds in exploratory activities in the country . Shell - BP in the pursuit of commercially available petroleum found oil in Oloibiri , Nigeria in 1956 . Other important oil wells discovered during the period were Afam and Bomu in Ogoni territory . Production of crude oil began in 1957 and in 1960 , a total of 847,000 tonnes of crude oil was exported . Towards the end of the 1950s , non-British firms were granted license to explore for oil : Mobil in 1955 , Tenneco in 1960 , Gulf Oil and later Chevron in 1961 , Agip in 1962 , and Elf in 1962 . Prior to the discovery of oil , Nigeria ( like many other African countries ) strongly relied on agricultural exports to other countries to supply their economy .

The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells. | Question: Gamma delta T cells have a different version of what receptor?", ['T cell', 'T cell receptor (TCR)', 'alternative T cell receptor (TCR)'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6602'), ('Context: The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as Commander, with two rookies.

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.  On the 24th April 1567, Mary was kidnapped by Bothwell (it is | Question: What was the name of the letters that in 1566 implicated Mary Queen of Scots in the murder of her second husband, Lord Darnley?', ['casket letters'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1935'), ('Context: In economics , an inferior good is a good whose demand decreases when consumer income rises ( or demand rises when consumer income decreases ) , unlike normal goods , for which the opposite is observed .

Get Known if you don\'t have an account  Share  Life finds a way .  "Oh yeah, \'oooh, ahhh.\' That\'s how it always starts. Then later there\'s running, and screaming."  — Dr. Ian Malcolm , in The Lost World: Jurassic Park , neatly summarizes each of the movies in the series.  Scientists discover the ability to bring extinct animals back to life via a complex cloning process. To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.  Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong .  The 1990 book Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton , while the 1993 movie Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg . Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008. But it all worked out, and the fourth film, titled Jurassic World , was released in 2015. After a highly successful run at the box office, positive reviews, and a resurrection of the franchise in general, a fifth film is to be released on June 22, 2018.

In the Sega Master System game, instead of trying to escape the island, Grant is called to fight and capture the dinosaurs. At the end of the game, he defeats the Tyrannosaurus rex and the park is allowed to open as planned.  Both human female characters in the first film are more capable than their counterparts in the book. In the book, Ellie is mostly passive and stays out of the action; in the film, she is involved just as much as the men around her and even calls out Hammond when he tries to imply he should take a dangerous mission because of her gender. Lex meanwhile was a pre-pubescent in the book and little more than The Load . The film ages her up to her teens and gives her computer skills key to getting the survivors out alive.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ("Context: Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales ( released overseas as Pirates of the Caribbean : Salazar 's Revenge ) is a 2017 American swashbuckler fantasy film .

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

He soon hooked up with Alison Moyet , an R&B singer with a powerful deep alto, and started recording as Yazoo . (In the U.S., after the blues record label Yazoo sued them, they were known as Yaz.) The first Yazoo single, "Only You" b/w "Situation," was a double-sided smash, and their debut, Upstairs at Eric\'s (named after Mute Records\' head Eric Radcliffe) went gold in the U.K. After they finished recording their second album, You and Me Both, Clarke opted out of the group. Yazoo was the template for Erasure , Clarke\'s long-running collaboration with diva Andy Bell , and numerous new bands that blended dance-pop and synthesizers. In 2008, Clarke and Moyet united for a tour of the U.K., Europe, and North America. The concerts were recorded and the result is this two-CD set. Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance. At the end of "State Farm," the funky white-girl rap from You and Me Both that kicks off side two of the set, Moyet laughs with almost girlish delight at the crowd\'s enthusiastic reaction. The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts. There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along. The sound on the set is a bit muddy, but the duo\'s enthusiastic performance more than makes up for the sonic limitations. ~ j. poet  Reconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusicReconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Reconnected: Live  google+  AllMusic Review                             by j. poet  In the early \'80s, Vince Clarke quit Depeche Mode , allegedly dissatisfied with their move toward pop music.

As early as 28 April 1971 , the Indian Cabinet had asked General Manekshaw ( Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee ) to `` Go into East Pakistan '' . Hostile relations in the past between India and Pakistan added to India 's decision to intervene in Pakistan 's civil war . Resultantly , the Indian government decided to support the creation of a separate state for ethnic Bengalis by supporting the Mukti Bahini . For this , RAW , helped to organise , train and arm these insurgents . Consequently , the Mukti Bahini succeeded in harassing Pakistani military in East Pakistan , thus creating conditions conducive for a full - scale Indian military intervention in early December . Thus , wary of the growing involvement of India , the Pakistan Air Force ( PAF ) launched a pre-emptive strike on Indian Air Force bases on 3 December 1971 . The attack was modelled on the Israeli Air Force 's Operation Focus during the Six - Day War , and intended to neutralise the Indian Air Force planes on the ground .

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. | Question: Who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', ['fox talbot', 'henry fox talbot'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6913'), ('Context: The Kansas -- Nebraska Act divided the nation and pointed it toward civil war .

There are ten numbercodedspecimens measuringapproximately 1 x 1 1/2 inches(except the diamond, dont you wish!). The determination of the hardness of a mineral can be an important step toward its identification. Hardness is the resistance which the smooth surfof a mineral offers to being scratched. A diamond is the hardest of all substances and can only be scratched by another diamond. Over a century ago, Friedrich Mohs by experimentation made up a scale of hardness which is referred to as Mohs scale. It does not imply an exact hardness, but is set up so that any mineral can scratch all those beneath it in the scale, or can be scratched by those above it in the scale. Since a diamond is the hardest it is given the number 10; talc is the softest so it is given number 1. Quartz is often used as a division in the scale and all those above 7 are called hard minerals. Here are the samples included in the set and their number on the scale of hardness: 1 Talc 6 Feldspar 2 Gypsum 7 Quartz 3 Calcite 8 Beryl 4 Fluorite 9 Corundum 5 Apatite 10 Diamond Some very familiar objects can be used in conjunction with this scale. A fingernail has the hardness of 2. 5, a copper coin between 3 and 4, a nail about 5, common window glass 5. 5, a steel file or porcelain tile 6. 5. Other minerals are sometimes substituted in the scale such as topaz for beryl since they both have a hardness of 8. Scale of hardness with diamond is recommended for grades 6 to 12.

The hardness of a mineral largely determines its durability and is related also to the strength and toughness of solid substances. It is important not to confuse hardness of a material with strength. Many hard materials (such as diamonds) are brittle and will break easily if they are struck. However, in common usage the term 'hardness' is often extended to include strength and toughness.  Strength of Materials  A full discussion of the strength of materials is beyond the scope of this Entry. Suffice it to say that there are different types of strength:  Types of strength  Bending  When it is bent.  Hence, in simple terms, the strength of a material is a measure of its resistance to various forms of deformation.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.

Gold:  \xa0 South Korea  Summary  Although they had never won a gold medal at the Olympics, Brazil was favored to do so now. The squad featured top players like [Hulk], [Marcelo] and [Neymar] along with a host of talents, several of which had played when Brazil won the 2011 U-20 World Cup. Their chief opponents were expected to be Spain. They had won the European qualifier, their senior team had just won Euro 2012, and a few of those players also competed at the Olympics: [Javi Martínez], [Juan Mata] and [Jordi Alba]. Other contenders were the unknown British team – composed of English and Welsh players, featuring veteran star [Ryan Giggs] – and Mexico, which had placed third at the 2011 U-20 Worlds (runner-up Portugal didn't qualify). Four teams débuted at the Olympics: Belarus, Gabon, Senegal and United Arab Emirates.  The biggest surprise of the preliminaries was the elimination of Spain, which lost twice and drew once. The other favorites did proceed to the quarter-finals, where the hosts lost to South Korea on penalties. Brazil won 3-2 over tiny Honduras after being 1-2 down, while Mexico needed extra time against Senegal. The fourth semi-finalist was Japan, which ousted Egypt.  Both Japan and Mexico had only once before reached the semi-final stage of an Olympic football tournament, both in 1968, when the Japanese beat Mexico for the bronze. This time, the Central Americans proceeded despite an early lead through Japan's [Yuki Otsu]. South Korea, first-time Olympic semi-finalist, was too weak for the Brazilians, who proceeded into their third Olympic final.  Brazil was heavily favored for the gold, but the Mexicans delivered a sensitive blow only 28 seconds into the game, when [Oribe Peralta] struck after a defensive error. The Brazilians dominated most of the match, but were unable to seriously threaten the Mexican defense.

Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937 , but chose in early 1936 to move re-militarization forward by a year for several reasons , namely : the ratification by the French National Assembly of the Franco - Soviet pact of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against Franco - Soviet `` encirclement '' ; the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937 ; the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge ; economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regime 's popularity ; the Italo - Ethiopian War , which had set Britain against Italy , had effectively broken up the Stresa Front ; and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year . In his biography of Hitler , the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitler 's preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks , and Hitler 's need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 1935 -- 36 . | Question: who defied the treaty of versailles by sending troops into the rhineland ?", ['Adolf Hitler'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-31482'), ('Context: Electrical Conductivity and Resistivity - nde-ed.orgElectrical Properties  Electrical Conductivity and Resistivity  It is well known that one of the subatomic particles of an atom is the electron. The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. At any moment in time many individual lattice atoms will be away from their perfect lattice sites and this interferes with electron movement.  When the temperature coefficient is known, an adjusted resistivity value can be computed using the following formula:  R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1–T2)]  Where: R1 = resistivity value adjusted | Question: What electrical property, the reciprocal of resistivity, has the SI units Siemens per metre?', ['conductivity'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4196'), ("Context: Santa Claus , also known as Saint Nicholas , Kris Kringle , Father Christmas , or simply Santa , is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well - behaved ( `` good '' or `` nice '' ) children on Christmas Eve ( 24 December ) and the early morning hours of Christmas Day ( 25 December ) .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

Belfast West was the fourth by-election held since the 2010 General Election. There were 6 candidates on the ballot paper.  The by-election was called after the former MP, Gerry Adams, vacated his seat.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).  Current MP: Paul Maskey (Sinn Fein) Born 1969. Belfast councillor 2001-2009. MLA for Belfast West since 2007.  2011 By-election.  Gerry Adams resigned from the Commons on the 26th January 2011 in order to contest the seat of Louth in the Republic of Ireland general election. Adams initially refused to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds or manor of Northstead, instead attempting to resign by writing to the Speaker. He was subsequently appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead. The by-election was held on the 9th June and was a easy hold for Sinn Fein.

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders. | Question: What needs to be larger to get the same work out of lower pressure steam?', ['cylinder volume', 'cylinder'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3344'), ('Context: The Lord of the Rings is a film series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson .

Fought 1642-1651, the English Civil War saw King Charles I battle Parliament.\xa0 The war began as a result of a conflict over the power of the monarchy and the rights of Parliament.\xa0 During the early phases of the war, the Parliamentarians\xa0expected to retain Charles as king, but\xa0with expanded powers for Parliament.\xa0 Though the Royalists won early victories, the Parliamentarians ultimately triumphed.\xa0 As the conflict progressed, Charles was executed and a\xa0republic formed.\xa0 Though Charles II was invited to take the throne in 1660, Parliament's victory set the nation on the path toward a parliamentary monarchy.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0  King Charles I of England. Photograph Source: Public Domain  English Civil War: Causes  Ascending to\xa0the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1625, Charles I believed\xa0in the divine right of kings.\xa0 This led him to frequently clash with Parliament as their approval\xa0was needed for raising funds.\xa0 Dissolving Parliament on several occasions, he was angered by\xa0its attacks on his ministers and reluctance to provide him with money.\xa0 In 1629, Charles elected to stop calling Parliaments and\xa0began funding his rule through\xa0outdated taxes such as ship money and various fines.\xa0 This approach\xa0angered the population and nobles.\xa0 In 1638, Charles encountered\xa0difficulty when he attempted to impose a new Book of Prayer on the Church of\xa0Scotland.\xa0 This action touched off the Bishops' Wars\xa0and led the Scots to document their grievances\xa0in the National Covenant.\xa0  Earl of Strafford. Photograph Source: Public Domain  English Civil War: The Road to War  Lacking the funds to put down the revolt in Scotland, Charles was compelled to call a Parliament in 1640.\xa0 Known as the Short Parliament, he dissolved it in less than a month after its leaders criticized his policies.\xa0 Defeated by the Scots, who captured Durham and Northumberland, and still needing money, he recalled the group that fall.\xa0 Reconvening in November, the Parliament immediately began introducing reforms including a need for regular\xa0parliaments and\xa0prohibiting the king from dissolving the body without the members' consent.\xa0 The situation worsened when Parliament ordered the Earl of Strafford, a close advisor of the king, executed for treason.\xa0 In January 1642, an\xa0angry Charles marched on Parliament with 400 men to arrest five members.\xa0 Failing, he withdrew to Oxford.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0  Earl of Essex.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

This period was known as the ‘golden age’ of Australian tennis.  In the 1960s, men's tennis open titles were dominated by six Australian men: Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Ken Rosewall, and Fred Stolle. Between 1961 and 1970, Australian men's tennis champions won at least one Open Singles title every year at either Wimbledon or the French or US Opens, as well as the Australian Open titles. In men's tennis, the golden age culminated in 1969 with Rod Laver's second Grand Slam win, as well as four major titles in the same year.  Margaret Court, courtesy of Australian Open  In 1970, Margaret Court also completed the Grand Slam. Court is one of only three women ever to win four international tennis open titles in one year. Indigenous player Evonne Goolagong Cawley was also a strong force in women's tennis in Australia in the 1970s with wins at Wimbledon, the French and the Australian Opens.  The ‘golden age’ for Australian tennis players declined from 1969 when amateur players were joined by professionals. Also by the 1980s, the Australian Open synchronised its dates to begin in January in line with the European, UK and USA players events schedule, which greatly widened the pool of players.  Yet even following the decline of Australia's dominance in the Grand Slam tournaments, tennis remained popular in urban areas and the Australian Open grows in popularity as a spectator sport.  Early tennis development 1900s–1950s  The golden age of Australian tennis was built on the early successes of both men's and women's tennis with Grand Slam tournament winners: Norman Brookes in the 1900s to 1919, Jack Crawford in the early 1930s, and Harry Hopman from 1929–39. This was in tandem with the consistent wins and popularity of women's tennis from the 1920s to the 1950s. Daphne Akhurst reached the Wimbledon final in 1925 and won the Doubles in 1928. From the1930s to the 1950s, Nancy Bolton got to the USA Singles Open and won other titles with her doubles partner, Thelma Long. Bolton was ranked No.4 in 1947 and stayed in that position until 1949.  This series of wins in the amateur Grand Slam tournament titles of the 1940s and 1950s was made possible by extensive community and industry support, and investment in the development and administration of amateur tennis players.  Harry Hopman, courtesy of Australian Open  Harry Hopman was a captain turned coach of 22 Australian Davis Cup teams between 1939 and 1967. As coach Hopman guided Australian male tennis players to 15 Davis Cup victories in 20 years. Ken Rosewall, Frank Sedgeman, John Bromwich, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Lew Hoad and Margaret Smith Court were all either trained by Harry Hopman or managed by Nell Hopman. ( The Hopman Era: Australia on the Rise)  Amateurs, tennis community and industry in the 1960s  By 1969 the game started to change. Professional players were invited to join the amateurs at the Grand Slam tournaments and prize money was offered for the first time, different tennis court surfaces and different game strategies emerged, and metal racquets were introduced.  Professional versus amateur  In 1969, the Australian Open Championships became 'open' to amateurs and professionals. This followed in the footsteps of the French Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, UK, and the USA Open. Rod Laver returned to win his second grand slam in 1969.  The advantages to amateur Australian champions who had enjoyed the riches of the Davis Cup endorsements soon disappeared with the advent of ‘open’ tennis. The end of the golden age was seen in the average age of the Davis Cup team, which was 35 years.

The bulletin was the first permanent 30-minute news broadcast in the United Kingdom, and although initially scheduled for only thirteen weeks due to fears that its length would turn viewers off,  the bulletin proved to be highly popular with audiences and became a fixture of the ITV schedule.  News at Ten rose to popularity for its winning combination of in-depth, analytical news coverage and populist stories.  It simultaneously helped popularise newscasters such as Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, Sandy Gall, Anna Ford, Alastair Stewart and Trevor McDonald into well-known television personalities.  When the bulletin was axed in 1999 in order for primetime entertainment programming to air uninterrupted, there was a public outcry. ITV reluctantly brought News at Ten back in 2001, airing it at 10pm for a minimum of three nights per week, but eventually replaced it with the ITV News at 10:30 in 2004. It was not until January 2008 that News at Ten was permanently reinstated to the ITV schedule. The programme\'s current newscaster is Tom Bradby, with Julie Etchingham, Rageh Omaar and Nina Hossain deputising.  History  1967 to 1999: the original run  ITN had been ITV\'s news provider since the channel\'s launch in September 1955. News updates from ITN tended to run 14 minutes in length at most, with no fixed broadcast time.  From his arrival in 1956, ITN editor Geoffrey Cox had consistently argued to the Independent Television Authority that ITN should be providing at least one news bulletin of substantial length, in order to cover and analyse major news stories more closely. ITV argued against the idea of a 30-minute evening bulletin, insisting a news programme of such length would eat into its primetime entertainment schedule and turn viewers away from the channel, but the ITA granted Cox\'s wish in 1967. ITV reluctantly agreed to give the proposed bulletin – a Monday-to-Friday programme, fixed at 10pm – a 13-week trial run to test its success.   News at Ten began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 under the editorship of Cox, who stipulated that the aim of the new programme was to "remove the spin and bring facts and the news as it really was." ITV\'s stance was seemingly confirmed early; the programme had little news to cover in its first few editions, having launched in the middle of summer during a slow news week. However, a reversal of fortunes quickly took place after an "action story" from ITN reporter Alan Hart on the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders re-entering Crater, which ran for a then-unheard-of length of 5 minutes.  A series of similar in-depth reports eventually helped to give News at Ten a regular viewership of seven million every night, forcing ITV to keep the programme. By 1969, News at Ten had become the first news bulletin in Britain to enter the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week.      The arrival of the new 30-minute programme allowed ITN to give a more in-depth and detailed treatment of serious news for the first time on British television, as well as coverage of populist stories and issues that would attract the viewing audience. The programme built on these concepts by introducing reporter packages, not the norm then but now a staple of television news, and a team of two newscasters taking turns to read stories instead of a sole presenter: a two-man team would inject personality into television news, as well as allow breaking news to be handed to the newscaster not in vision. The original newscasting team included Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, George Ffitch and Leonard Parkin. News at Ten also employed several other distinctive features which proved popular with viewers: the use of Big Ben\'s chimes (or "bongs") to separate the news headlines being read in the opening sequence, and the "… And Finally" report – a quirky and often humorous end piece designed to send the viewing audience to bed "on a high note" | Question: Probably best remembered as being chief presenter of ITV\'s News At Ten between 1976 and 1991which British journalist and broadcaster sadly passed away on July 20th 2012?', ['alastair burnet'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1954'), ("Context: The soundtrack is nearly three hours long , and includes covers of the Led Zeppelin track , `` Immigrant Song '' , featuring Karen O of Yeah Yeah Yeahs , and the Bryan Ferry song , `` Is Your Love Strong Enough ?

The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.  A Last Hurrah  In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.  \xa0  Final Stop  After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.  \xa0  The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.  \xa0  At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

Dísir may act as protective spirits of Norse clans.  Their original function was possibly that of fertility goddesses who were the object of both private and official worship called dísablót, and their veneration may derive from the worship of the spirits of the dead.  The dísir, like the valkyries, norns, and vættir, are almost always referred to collectively.  The North Germanic dísir and West Germanic Idisi are believed by some scholars to be related due to linguistic and mythological similarities, but the direct evidence of Anglo-Saxon and Continental German mythology is limited.  The dísir play roles in Norse texts that resemble those of fylgjur, valkyries, and norns, so that some have suggested that dísir is a broad term including the other beings.

Her highness and the stubby breed have always gone together like crumpets and tea, but it appears their relationship is coming to an end. After owning corgis for most of her life, the Queen, 88, has declared that she will not take on anymore pets, reports the Washington Post .  Queen Elizabeth’s ban on accumulating more animals began when she recently turned down two Norfolk terriers offered to her by granddaughter Princess Beatrice as a gift, and now it’s extending to corgis as well.  “The fact is she worries about too many dogs around her feet and the danger she will trip up and hurt herself badly,” an unidentified member of the royal court told the Express .  “Her corgis are getting on a bit and move along at a sedate speed but a young dog would obviously be very lively and much more active. Her main fear is that if she fell and broke her arm or even a leg she would not be able to perform her duties for many weeks if not months, and that would upset her greatly.”  Her majesty currently owns two corgis, Willow and Holly, who shot to international fame in 2012 when they were included in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.  Throughout her life, the queen has cared for more than 30 corgis, starting as a young girl when her father, King George VI, brought home one of the dogs from a local kennel in 1933 , naming him Dookie.  From there, Queen Elizabeth’s fondness for the breed continued to grow. For her 18th birthday, she received her own pup named Susan. Susan went on to accompany the queen on her honeymoon.  Keeping with tradition, Her Majesty introduced the breed to her own family. A corgi named Sugar served as the nursery pet of Prince Charles and Princess Anne.  Even after the kids grew up, she kept bringing in new dogs. Queen Elizabeth has owned as many as eight corgis at once and, up until recently, was caring for five corgis, five cocker spaniels and four dachshund-corgi crossbreeds.  Now, it appears all those pups are catching up with the queen. According to Express, Her Highness does not plan on replacing her corgis or other pets after they pass.  Sounds like it’s now Prince William ’s job to carry on the corgi reign. No offense, Lupo .  Like us on Facebook for more stories like this!

However, it is telling that in this highly-stylised set of three mesmerising photographs, the second is of the Queen with Princess Anne and the third shows her in the garden at Windsor with her beloved corgis, Willow and Holly, and dorgies, Vulcan and Candy.\xa0  For the uninitiated, dorgies are possibly the first of the fashionable cross breeds, having been created when the young princesses crossed Princess Margaret’s dachshund, Pipkin, with the Queen’s corgi, Tiny.\xa0 And it is entirely fitting that\xa0we acknowledge the significance of her surest companions, who have been by her side even longer than Prince Philip. | Question: What dog breed has Queen Elizabeth II traditionally had as pets?", ['corgi'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2475'), ("Context: Hollywood stuntman Tanoai Reed ( known as Toa on the new American Gladiators ) is the great nephew of wrestling promoter Lia Maivia ( Peter Maivia 's wife ) , while professional wrestler Lina Fanene ( Nia Jax ) is Dwayne Johnson 's cousin .

Status: \xa0 False.  Origins: \xa0 As Santa Claus and his reindeer are to the secular celebration of Christmas, so the three wise men and the creche are to the religious celebration.  Even most of the non-religious (or non-Christian) among us recognize the symbolism of the nativity scene: it depicts the biblical account of three wise men from the east who rode atop camels and followed a star to Bethlehem, bearing gifts for the newborn Christ child who lay in a manger.  The truth is, the Bible contains virtually none of these details.  They have all been added over the years from sources outside the Bible.  Mathew 2:1 tells us:  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to  Jerusalem . . .  That\'s  it.  Matthew doesn\'t say how many wise men came from the east, doesn\'t mention their names, and doesn\'t provide any details about how they made their journey.  It has generally been assumed that the wise men (or magi) were three in number because Matthew 2:11 makes mention of three gifts:  ". . . they  presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh."  The number of wise men is not specified in the Bible, however, and some Eastern religions have claimed up to twelve of them made the journey to Bethlehem.   The names of the wise men, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, do not come from the Bible and did not appear in Christian literature until over five hundred years after the birth of Jesus.  Nothing in the Bible says the wise men rode camels (or any other animal); they may have made their journey from the east on foot for all we know.  And despite the familiar lyrics of the Christmas carol "We Three Kings," no biblical source depicts the three wise men as kings.  (They were most likely learned men, perhaps astrologers.)  However many wise men there were, and however they got to Bethlehem, the Bible tells us they arrived just after the birth and found the baby Jesus in a manger, right?  Not quite.  Matthew 2:11 states:  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped  him . . .  The wise men came "into the house," not the stable, and they saw a "young child," not a newborn.  This passage indicates that the wise men didn\'t arrive until quite some time after Jesus\' birth.  (According to  Luke 2,  it was shepherds, not wise men, who visited the infant Jesus in the manger.)  To sum up: we know from the Bible that wise men came from the east, that they followed a star to Bethlehem to find the Christ child, and that they brought him gold, and frankincense and myrrh.  We must look to sources external to the Bible to find the origins of any of the other familiar details, however.

A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two. | Question: If a force is pointing horizontally to the northeast, how many forces can you split the force into?', ['two'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10395'), ("Context: violet gibson : definition of violet gibson and synonyms ...violet gibson : definition of violet gibson and synonyms of violet gibson (English)  Gibson was born in Dublin , Ireland .  \xa0 Shooting of Mussolini  On 7 April 1926, Violet Gibson shot Mussolini, Italy's Fascist leader, while he sat in a car after leaving an assembly of the International Congress of Surgeons, to whom he had delivered a speech on the wonders of modern medicine. [1] Gibson shot at Mussolini three times twice hitting him in the nose. Gibson was almost lynched on the spot by an angry mob, but police intervened and took her off for questioning. Mussolini was wounded only slightly and after his nose was bandaged he continued his parade on the Capitoline .  At the time of the assassination attempt Violet Gibson was 50 years old and did not explain her reason for trying to assassinate Mussolini. It has been theorised that Gibson, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat , was insane at the time of the attack and the idea of assassinating Mussolini was hers and that she worked alone. Gibson was later deported [2] to Britain after being released without charge at the request of Mussolini. She spent the rest of her life in a mental asylum, St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton .

Come Here To Me!  Ninety years ago this week, a Dubliner tried to kill Benito\xa0Mussolini.  April 5, 2016 by Donal  Benito Mussolini with a bandaged nose, after the 1926 shooting:  In April 1926, President W.T Cosgrave sent by telegram his best wishes to a recently wounded Benito Mussolini. Coming after an attempt on the life of the Fascist leader, Cosgrave wrote:  On behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, I have the honour to congratulate Your Excellency, and the Italian people, on the providential escape of Your Excellency from the odious attempt on your person. Sincerely hoping that the wound is not serious, I send you my most earnest wishes for your speedy recover. The infamous attempt has caused much indignation here.  For Cosgrave, it was particularly important that the Free State send its best wishes, as it was an Irish assailant who made the attempt on Mussolini’s life. Ninety years ago this Thursday, Dublin born woman Violet Gibson fired a revolver shot in Rome that could have changed the course of human history. The story is well known today, and has been the subject of a book and an excellent RTE Radio documentary . This post is \xa0primarily concerned only with how the event was reported at home.  The shooting of Mussolini in front of an adoring crowd was a dramatic event, and that drama was captured in contemporary press reports. The Irish Times reported that  The Italian Prime Minister, after opening the International Surgical Congress in the Capitol of Rome, was passing through a cheering crowd in the square to his motor care, when “an elderly woman in dark clothes” (afterwards identified as the Hon. Violet Gibson) dashed out and fired a small revolver almost point-blank in his face….  Signor Mussolini remained self-composed, reassured his entourage, and while pressing a handkerchief to the wound, gave orders that no reprisals were to be carried out against his assailant, who had been arrested. She was protected by police from the fury of the crowd, who tried to lynch her. She was carried to the police station by police and carabineers.  The shot Gibson fired grazed the nose of Mussolini, and while the press here condemned the “wicked and unprovoked attack”, in truth she did little damage to Mussolini beyond \xa0his requiring a bandaged nose for a number of days.

Over the centuries, a geocentric view of the universe — with Earth at the center of everything — gave way to the proper understanding we have today of an expanding universe in which our galaxy is but one of billions. On this list are some of the most famous scientists from the early days of astronomy through the modern era, and a summary of some of their achievements.  Any list of famous astronomers has to include a varied collection of great scientists from the Greeks to the modern era, big thinkers who tackled many fields as well as modern astronomers who made significant discoveries and helped popularize astronomy.  Credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com  The Ptolemaic geocentric model of the universe, devised by the Greek scientist Claudius Ptolemy, had everything revolving around Earth.  Credit: Bartolomeu Velho, Public Domain  When most people believed the world was flat, the notable Greek mathematician, astronomer and geographer Eratosthenes (276 BCE- 195 BCE) used the sun to measure the size of the round Earth. His measurement of 24,660 miles (39,690 kilometers) was only 211 miles (340 km) off the true measurement.  The ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (AD 90- 168) set up a model of the solar system in which the sun, stars, and other planets revolved around Earth. Known as the Ptolemaic system, it remained in place for hundreds of years, though it turned out to be flat wrong.  Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986), known as Azophi to Westerners, made the first known observation of a group of stars outside of the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy.  Nicolaus Copernicus  Credit: Public Domain  In 16th century Poland, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a model of the solar system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. The model wasn't completely correct, as astronomers of the time struggled with the backwards path Mars sometimes took, but it eventually changed the way many scientists viewed the solar system.  Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles but in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today.  Galileo Galilei is credited with discovering the first four moons of Jupiter.  Credit: NASA  Born in Italy, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is often credited with the creation of the optical telescope, though in truth he improved on existing models. The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) turned the new observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons), as well as the rings of Saturn. Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. Galileo is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.  Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomena that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the first observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its moon, Titan.  Building on the work of those who had gone before him, English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws.

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

If you like, skip Scotland\'s                  stone age, and click down to bronze age , iron age (the Celts), Roman                  Britain (the Picts), or Dalriada (early                  Scottish history).  Stone Age in Ancient Scotland  Archeology is a fascinating field of study. You get to spend your life holding,                  for instance, a small carved stone ball up to the light while                  saying "What in the world did they use this for?" The                  two favorite words of archeologists? probably. possibly.  Probably farming began to take hold in ancient Scotland around 4000 BC.                  Possibly the carved stone balls were used for a game. In the east,                  people were buried in large barrows (called cairns when made with                  stones). In the west, they used chambered cairns (everyone got                  their own spot). Later, possibly, these two cultures merged under                  the new technologies, greater population, and increased trade of the Bronze Age.  Archeologists do magnificent work, bringing the past to light, but must walk                  a fine line between assuming ancient peoples thought exactly the                  way we do with very similar motivations and interests, or conversely                  lived in a world of such deep superstition and barbarity that                  we should be unable to relate to their concerns and activities                  in any way. It\'s a tough task. Once in a while, archeologists                  are rewarded with a very well-preserved site, such as Skara Brae                  in the Orkneys.  Undercovered by a storm in 1850, the village of Skara Brae survived under sand                  for 5000 years almost completely intact. Why? Because virtually                  everything was made of stone - houses, beds, dressers and shelves                  - even wall recesses with drains beneath, suggesting indoor facilities.                  They had to use stone, since Orkney has few trees.  Other sites, similar to Skara Brae, suggest that the Orkney tribes were                  totem-based. At Cuween Hill, many dog skulls have been found,                  while the Ibister were people of the eagle.  These were the early years of the great henges and stone circles, though                  most were built during the Bronze Age, including some of the largest                  such as Stone Henge. What is a henge? Henges include the circles                  of stone, but are surrounded by a ditch, with the earth dug up                  and piled around the outer perimeter of the ditch, encircling and protecting the stone and timber arrangements inside.  There is a great deal of speculation about the uses of the circles.                  Many included altars and burials. Some seem oriented toward the                  sun and some toward the moon. It would seem they may have been                  used for a variety of purposes depending on the time, place and                  current culture. Popular imagination peoples the henges with druids,                  but the circles of stone predate the druids by many, many centuries.  Bronze Age in Ancient Scotland  Archeologists believe that new people, called the Beaker people after their                  most common archealogical product, moved to the Isles around 2500                  BC bringing their metalworking skills and culture with them. This                  was a peaceful influx, a more technologically advanced society                  influencing and dominating the less advanced. However, the Beaker                  people embraced wholeheartedly the notion of stone circles and                  they are the ones who perfected the art. So cultural exchange                  worked both ways.  Scottish culture changed dramatically with the advent of metalworking.                  Learning to smelt gold and copper, and later to combine copper                  and tin into sturdy bronze, opened broad new vistas in trade,                  the arts, accumulation of wealth, and warfare. All of these produced                  commensurate changes in class structure and ancient society.

Over the centuries, a geocentric view of the universe — with Earth at the center of everything — gave way to the proper understanding we have today of an expanding universe in which our galaxy is but one of billions. On this list are some of the most famous scientists from the early days of astronomy through the modern era, and a summary of some of their achievements.  Any list of famous astronomers has to include a varied collection of great scientists from the Greeks to the modern era, big thinkers who tackled many fields as well as modern astronomers who made significant discoveries and helped popularize astronomy.  Credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com  The Ptolemaic geocentric model of the universe, devised by the Greek scientist Claudius Ptolemy, had everything revolving around Earth.  Credit: Bartolomeu Velho, Public Domain  When most people believed the world was flat, the notable Greek mathematician, astronomer and geographer Eratosthenes (276 BCE- 195 BCE) used the sun to measure the size of the round Earth. His measurement of 24,660 miles (39,690 kilometers) was only 211 miles (340 km) off the true measurement.  The ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (AD 90- 168) set up a model of the solar system in which the sun, stars, and other planets revolved around Earth. Known as the Ptolemaic system, it remained in place for hundreds of years, though it turned out to be flat wrong.  Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986), known as Azophi to Westerners, made the first known observation of a group of stars outside of the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy.  Nicolaus Copernicus  Credit: Public Domain  In 16th century Poland, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a model of the solar system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. The model wasn't completely correct, as astronomers of the time struggled with the backwards path Mars sometimes took, but it eventually changed the way many scientists viewed the solar system.  Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles but in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today.  Galileo Galilei is credited with discovering the first four moons of Jupiter.  Credit: NASA  Born in Italy, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is often credited with the creation of the optical telescope, though in truth he improved on existing models. The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) turned the new observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons), as well as the rings of Saturn. Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. Galileo is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.  Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomena that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the first observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its moon, Titan.  Building on the work of those who had gone before him, English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws.

As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time. | Question: The presence or absence of what can be used to determine the relative age of the formations in which they are found?", ['organisms'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-5178'), ("Context: UK Butterflies - Red Admiral - Vanessa atalantaUK Butterflies - Red Admiral - Vanessa atalanta  < Previous Species Next Species >  Introduction  The Red Admiral is a frequent visitor to gardens throughout the British Isles and one of our most well-known butterflies. This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.

Last update: 7 February 2016  Google+175  History and origin  About a 35% of the world population drives on the left , and the countries that do are mostly old British colonies. This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world, but there is a perfectly good reason. Click here for a world map and a full list of all countries of the world and the side of the road on which they drive.  Right-handed knights preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent  In the past, almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.  Furthermore, a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse, and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword (which would be worn on the left). It is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road, rather than in the middle of traffic, so if one mounts on the left, then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road.  In the late 1700s, however, teamsters in France and the United States began hauling farm products in big wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. These wagons had no driver’s seat; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse, so he could keep his right arm free to lash the team. Since he was sitting on the left, he naturally wanted everybody to pass on the left so he could look down and make sure he kept clear of the oncoming wagon’s wheels. Therefore he kept to the right side of the road.  In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth (Elizaveta Petrovna) officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right.\xa0In addition, the French Revolution of 1789 gave a huge impetus to right-hand travel in Europe. The fact is, before the Revolution, the aristocracy travelled on the left of the road, forcing the peasantry over to the right, but after the storming of the Bastille and the subsequent events, aristocrats preferred to keep a low profile and joined the peasants on the right. An official keep-right rule was introduced in Paris in 1794, more or less parallel to Denmark, where driving on the right had been made compulsory in 1793.  French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1812)  Later, Napoleon’s conquests spread the new rightism to the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), Switzerland, Germany, Poland and many parts of Spain and Italy. The states that had resisted Napoleon kept left – Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Portugal. This European division, between the left- and right-hand nations would remain fixed for more than 100 years, until after the First World War.  Although left-driving Sweden ceded Finland to right-driving Russia after the Finnish War (1808-1809), Swedish law – including traffic regulations – remained valid in Finland for another 50 years. It wasn’t until 1858 that an Imperial Russian decree made Finland swap sides.  The trend among nations over the years has been toward driving on the right, but Britain has done its best to stave off global homogenisation. With the expansion of travel and road building in the 1800s, traffic regulations were made in every country. Left-hand driving was made mandatory in Britain in 1835.

Paul Hayes Tucker is the leading expert on Monet in the USA. This book locates the series paintings within the context of their time. Tucker looks at the development of his art before the 1890s and the cultural pressures of the 1880s that caused Monet to turn to serial painting.  He focuses on the major and minor series of paintings from the 1890s - including the paintings of Rouen Cathedral - and examines how they were painted and how they were received.  “To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor. What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me."  — Claude Monet  About Rouen Cathedral  Rouen Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral in Rouen, in northwestern France.  It\'s the seat of the Archbishop of Rouen and the building of Notre dame Cathedral started in 1200 and contains nearly the entire history of the Gothic style over a period of some 400 years. In the middle ages it\'s also where the kings of France were crowned.  Rouen is also situated some 60 kilometres from Giverny and is a city which Monet - and the French - knew well.  When looked at from the perspective of his paintings prior to 1892, the important thing to note is that he had never before before focused on one building or architectural element or even painted one motif as often as he did with Rouen Cathedral and its facades.  It\'s maybe important to note that Turner - the other great painter of atmosphere and light - had also created an engraving of Rouen Cathedral as part of his series on River Scenery in France.  The novelty of working with one motif meant that it became imbued with meaning. Hayes Tucker points to the religious revival in France in the 1890s and the fact that a Gothic Cathedral was a distinctly French symbol. Importantly Gothic was perceived in the 1890s as being symbolic  "Rouen Cathedral, West Facade, Sunlight" by Claude Monet | Source  Rouen and its Cathedral - background - articles on Wikipedia  map of Rouen Cathedral and the places where Monet painted  Monet\'s paintings of Rouen Cathedral - displayed as a series  Location and Dates  The Location  Monet\'s home area is Normandy.

The paintings were painted from the second stories of 23, place de la Cathdrale (1892) and 81, rue Grand-Pont (1893), but were later finished in the artist\'s studio at Giverny, where they were worked on together and interrelated as a group.

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil\'s people", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "scharfe Barmherzigkeit" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames." Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews\' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these "envenomed worms" would be forced into labour or expelled "for all time". In Robert Michael\'s view, Luther\'s words "We are at fault in not slaying them" amounted to a sanction for murder.

Within 20 minutes, the vessel sank into the Celtic Sea. Of 1,959 passengers and crew, 1,198 people were drowned, including 128 Americans. The attack aroused considerable indignation in the United States, but Germany defended the action, noting that it had issued warnings of its intent to attack all ships, neutral or otherwise, that entered the war zone around Britain.  When World War I erupted in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson pledged neutrality for the United States, a position that the vast majority of Americans favored. Britain, however, was one of America’s closest trading partners, and tension soon arose between the United States and Germany over the latter’s attempted quarantine of the British isles. Several U.S. ships traveling to Britain were damaged or sunk by German mines, and in February 1915 Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare in the waters around Britain.  In early May 1915, several New York newspapers published a warning by the German embassy in Washington that Americans traveling on British or Allied ships in war zones did so at their own risk. The announcement was placed on the same page as an advertisement of the imminent sailing of the Lusitania liner from New York back to Liverpool. The sinkings of merchant ships off the south coast of Ireland prompted the British Admiralty to warn the Lusitania to avoid the area or take simple evasive action, such as zigzagging to confuse U-boats plotting the vessel’s course. The captain of the Lusitania ignored these recommendations, and at 2:12 p.m. on May 7 the 32,000-ton ship was hit by an exploding torpedo on its starboard side. The torpedo blast was followed by a larger explosion, probably of the ship’s boilers, and the ship sunk in 20 minutes.  It was revealed that the Lusitania was carrying about 173 tons of war munitions for Britain, which the Germans cited as further justification for the attack. The United States eventually sent three notes to Berlin protesting the action, and Germany apologized and pledged to end unrestricted submarine warfare. In November, however, a U-boat sunk an Italian liner without warning, killing 272 people, including 27 Americans. Public opinion in the United States began to turn irrevocably against Germany.  On January 31, 1917, Germany, determined to win its war of attrition against the Allies, announced that it would resume unrestricted warfare in war-zone waters. Three days later, the United States broke diplomatic relations with Germany, and just hours after that the American liner Housatonic was sunk by a German U-boat. On February 22, Congress passed a $250 million arms appropriations bill intended to make the United States ready for war. In late March, Germany sunk four more U.S. merchant ships, and on April 2 President Wilson appeared before Congress and called for a declaration of war against Germany. On April 4, the Senate voted to declare war against Germany, and two days later the House of Representatives endorsed the declaration. With that, America entered World War I.

The most common opinion, however, seems to be that it had nine. What made the Hydra so difficult was the fact that, whenever one of its heads was chopped off, two would grow in its place. Hercules managed to get around this rather major obstacle by having his nephew, Iolaus, cauterize each stump with a hot iron as soon as Hercules could chop off a head. The hero then buried the monster\'s immortal head beneath a rock. The task was made somewhat more difficult by Juno, who sent a crab to nip at the feet of Hercules while he battled the Hydra. - Hydra  Various authors have given us different numbers for how many heads Hydra had originally.

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards. | Question: What dynasties inspired the Chinese-like elements of Kublai's government?", ['native Chinese dynasties', 'Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-8291'), ("Context: The centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, the rural-based National Party of Australia, and the environmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria's main political parties.

LAKE DISTRICT, in England, a district containing all the principal English lakes, and variously termed the Lake Country, Lakeland and " the Lakes." It falls within the north-western counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire (Furness district), about one-half being within the first of these. Although celebrated far outside the confines of Great Britain as a district of remarkable and strongly individual physical beauty, its area is only some 700 sq. m., a circle with radius of 15 M. from the central point covering practically the whole. Within this circle, besides the largest lake, Windermere, is the highest point in England, Scafell Pike; yet Windermere is but roe m. in length, and covers an area of 5.69 sq. m., while Scafell Pike is only 3210 ft. in height. But the lakes show a wonderful variety of character, from open expanse and steep rock-bound shores to picturesque island-groups and soft wooded banks; while the mountains have always a remarkable dignity, less from the profile of their summits than from the bold sweeping lines of their flanks, unbroken by vegetation, and often culminating in sheer cliffs or crags. At their feet, the flat green valley floors of the higher elevations give place in the lower parts to lovely woods. The streams are swift and clear, and numerous small waterfalls are characteristic of the district. To the north, west and south, a flat coastal belt, bordering the Irish Sea, with its inlets Morecambe Bay and Solway Firth, and broadest in the north, marks off the Lake District, while to the east the valleys of the Eden and the Lune divide it from the Pennine mountain system. Geologically, too, it is individual. Its centre is of volcanic rocks, complex in character, while the Coal-measures and New Red Sandstone appear round the edges. The district as a whole is grooved by a main depression, running from north to south along the valleys of St John, Thirlmere, Grasmere\' and Windermere, . surmounting a pass (Dunmail Raise) of only 783 ft.; while a secondary depression, in the same direction, runs along Derwentwater, Borrowdale, Wasdale and Wastwater, but here Sty Head Pass, between Borrowdale and Wasdale, rises to 1600 ft. The centre of the 15-m. radius lies on the lesser heights between Langstrath and Dunmail Raise, which may, however, be the crown of an ancient dome of rocks, " the dissected skeleton of which, worn by the warfare of air and rain and ice, now alone remains " (Dr H. R.. Mill, " Bathymetrical Survey of the English Lakes," Geographical Journal, vi. 48). The principal features of the district may be indicated by following this circle round from north, by west, south and east. The river. Derwent (q.v.), rising in the tarns and " gills " or ghylls " (small streams running in deeply-grooved clefts) north of Sty Head Pass and the Scafell mass flows north through the wooded Borrowdale and forms Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite. These two lakes are in a class apart from all the rest, being broader for their length, and quite shallow (about 18 ft. average and 70 ft. maximum), as distinct from the long, narrow and deep troughs occupied by the other chief lakes, which average from 40 to 135 ft. deep. Derwentwater (q.v.), studded with many islands, is perhaps the most beautiful of all. Borrowdale is joined on the east by the bare wild dale of Langstrath, and the Greta joins the Derwent immediately below Derwentwater; the town of Keswick lying near the junction. Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite occupy a single depression, a flat alluvial plain separating them. From Seatoller In Borrowdale a road traverses Honister Pass (I loo ft.), whence it descends westward, beneath the majestic Honister Crags, where green slate is quarried, into the valley containing Buttermere (94 ft. max. depth) and Crummock Water (144 ft.) | Question: Which lake in the Lake District is separated from Crummock Water by a narrow alluvial flat?', ['buttermere'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4966'), ("Context: `` Love Is Like Oxygen '' is a song by the British band Sweet , co-written by the group 's guitarist Andy Scott and Trevor Griffin , a musician who had played with various unsuccessful bands before becoming a roadie and sound engineer , and released in January 1978 .

Each of these was associated with a season--Boreas was the cold breath of winter, Zephyros the god of spring breezes, and Notos the god of summer rain-storms.  The Winds were portrayed as either man-shaped, winged gods who lived together in a cavern on Mount Haimos (Haemus) in Thrake (Thrace), or as horse-shaped divinities stabled by Aiolos (Aeolus) Hippotades, "the Reiner of  Horses", on the island of Aiolia and set out to graze on the shores of the earth-encircling River Okeanos (Oceanus).  Early poets, such as Homer and Hesiod, drew a clear distinction between the four, relatively benign, seasonal Winds (Anemoi)  and the destructive Storm-Winds ( Anemoi Thuellai ). The latter, spawned by the monster Typhoeus, were either housed in the caverns of Aiolos or guarded by the Hekatonkheires in the pits of Tartaros . Later authors blurred the distinction between the two.  The female counterparts of the Anemoi were the Aellai Harpyiai (Harpies). Mated with the Winds they produced many  swift, immortal horses.

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards. | Question: What dynasties inspired the Chinese-like elements of Kublai's government?", ['native Chinese dynasties', 'Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-8291'), ('Context: How Many Gifts Are in the "Twelve Days of Christmas" Song?How Many Gifts Are in the "Twelve Days of Christmas" Song?  How Many Gifts Are in the "Twelve Days of Christmas" Song?  Tweet  364 gifts are in the “Twelve Days of Christmas” song if all of the gifts mentioned in each of the verses were added together. Each verse references a gift that corresponds with the particular day of Christmas, from one gift (a partridge in a pear tree) on the first day to 12 items (drummers drumming) on the final day, with each previous gift accumulating throughout each new day’s verse of the song. Combined, there would be: 12 partridges in pear trees, 22 turtle doves, 30 French hens, 36 calling birds, 40 gold rings, 42 geese a-laying, 42 swans a-swimming, 40 maids a-milking, 36 ladies dancing, 30 lords a-leaping, 22 pipers piping, and 12 drummers drumming.  More about “The Twelve Days of Christmas”:  Some historians believe the song originated from a children’s counting and tongue twister game, in which players had to recite the phrases correctly or be out.  The verse for the fourth day of Christmas, in which the gift is four calling birds, originally had lyrics for “collie birds” an old-fashioned term for blackbirds.  “Five golden rings” is thought to not be about jewelry but rather refer to pheasants, which have golden colored rings around their necks.  5 things you didn\'t know about \'The Twelve Days of Christmas\'5 things you didn\'t know about \'The Twelve Days of Christmas\'  5 things you didn\'t know about \'The Twelve Days of Christmas\'  On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me… Carsten/Three Lions/Getty Images  December 13, 2012  10 things you need to know today  Today\'s best articles  The week\'s best photojournalism  Daily business briefing  With only 12 days left \'til Christmas, we\'re in the heart of caroling season — and few songs would seem more appropriate than "The Twelve Days of Christmas." ( Listen to the carol below. ) But no matter how many times you\'ve sung it — or found ways to avoid singing it — how well do you really know the song? Here, 5 revelations about the ubiquitous, vaguely irritating "Twelve Days of Christmas":  1. The "Twelve Days" don\'t end on Christmas Day — they begin on it. The Holy Trinity Catholic Church explains that the "12 days of Christmas" don\'t begin on December 13 and end on Christmas Day; they begin on Christmas Day and end on January 5, marking the time of "merry-making" until the Epiphany. The singer\'s true love is generously extending his or her gift-giving for nearly two weeks after Christmas Day. (We\'re celebrating now anyway.)  2. It\'s "four colly birds," not "four calling birds." Mike O\'Connor of the Bird Watcher\'s General Store explains that "colly" is an obsolete synonym for "grimy or sooty, like a chimney sweep" — and the song\'s "colly birds" are actually blackbirds.

Overview  The skull is a bony structure found in many animals which serves as the general framework for the head . The skull supports the structures of the face and protects the head against injury.  The skull can be subdivided into two parts:  the cranium and the mandible. A skull that is missing a mandible is only a cranium; this is the source of a very commonly made error in terminology. Those animals having skulls are called craniates.  Protection of the brain is only one part of the function of a bony skull. For example, a fixed distance between the eyes is essential for stereoscopic vision , and a fixed position for the ears helps the brain to use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.  Human skulls  Human skull (front)  Human skull (side)  In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones . Except for the mandible , all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures , rigid articulations permitting very little movement.  Eight bones form the neurocranium (braincase), a protective vault surrounding the brain . Fourteen bones form the splanchnocranium, the bones supporting the face. Encased within the temporal bones are the six ear ossicles of the middle ears , though these are not part of the skull. The hyoid bone , supporting the tongue , is usually not considered as part of the skull either, as it does not articulate with any other bones.  The skull contains the sinus cavities , which are air-filled cavities lined with respiratory epithelium , which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are unclear; they may contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength,or they may be important in improving the resonance of the voice. In some animals, such as the elephant, the sinuses are extensive. The elephant skull needs to be very large, to form an attachment for muscles of the neck and trunk, but is also unexpectedly light; the comparatively small brain-case is surrounded by large sinuses which reduce the weight. The meninges are the three layers, or membranes, which surround the structures of the nervous system . They are known as the dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . Other than being classified together, they have little in common with each other.  In humans, the anatomical position for the skull is the Frankfurt plane , where the lower margins of the orbits and the upper borders of the ear canals are all in a horizontal plane. This is the position where the subject is standing and looking directly forward. For comparison, the skulls of other species, notably primates and hominids, may sometimes be studied in the Frankfurt plane. However, this does not always equate to a natural posture in life.  Possible types of skull fractures  Temporal Fenestra  This Massospondylus skull shows the two temporal fenestrae typical of diapsids .  The temporal fenestra are anatomical features of the amniote skull, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra is critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.  Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but the more advanced sauropsids and synapsids did. As time progressed, sauropsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. | Question: In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones, which are joined together by sutures, rigid articulations permitting very little movement, except for which one?", ['jaw'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2850'), ('Context: Jason Gilbert  Jason Gilbert, known by his nickname JG, is a Caymanian record producer and songwriter.

Since the play focuses on Hamlet and the revenge itself more so than the motivation , Shakespeare utilizes in medias res to bypass superfluous exposition . | Question: starting a story in the middle of the action ?", ['in medias res'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-40825'), ("Context: Mother’s Day 2014 – “Hagar, Mother of Faith” | Nicholas ...Mother’s Day 2014 – “Hagar, Mother of Faith” | Nicholas Hood III MInistries  Nicholas Hood III MInistries  Posted on May 10, 2014 by Nicholas Hood III Ministries  With this being a “Mother’s Day Post” I thought it might be nice to show a photo of a mother with her children.\xa0 This photo is of my wife, Denise and sons, Nathan and Noah years ago when the four of us drove to the Grand Canyon.\xa0  Hagar is the mother I would like to focus on for this Mother’s Day. In America sometimes Hagar and her children have been maligned. However, as I have read about Hagar and the significant role she plays in the Bible, I see her as an outstanding woman of faith.  Hagar was a secondary wife to Abraham. She was given to him as “Recompense” when he and Sarah left Egypt. You may remember that Abraham pretended that Sarah was his sister. Pharaoh took Sarah as his wife. After learning in a dream that she was actually the wife of Abraham, Pharaoh returned Sarah to Abraham along with one of his daughters, Hagar, who was given as “Recompense” to Abraham that there would be no hard feelings about him taking Sarah as his wife. As the years went by, Sarah was childless. After a while, Sarah encouraged Abraham to take Hagar, the slave girl, as his wife. Hagar becomes pregnant and that’s when the fireworks begin! Everything was alright between the two women until Hagar becomes pregnant. She teases Sarah about her inability to become pregnant. Hagar eventually gives birth to a son, Ishmael. Sarah tolerates Ishmael and Hagar for thirteen years until in her old age, Sarah gives birth to a son, Isaac. Sarah insists that Abraham put Hagar and Ishmael out. Reluctantly, Abraham follows the bidding of his wife, Sarah and sends Hagar and Ishmael into the wilderness. The Bible passage for today is about Hagar and Ishmael on their journey away from Abraham and Sarah. I hope you will take the time to read this passage of Scripture and place it in context of your thoughts about why we celebrate mothers on “Mother’s Day.”  Genesis 8: 8 The child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 9 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac. 10 So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac.” 11 The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son. 12 But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you. 13 As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your offspring.” 14 So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.  15 When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes. 16 Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Do not let me look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. 17 And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 18 Come, lift up the boy and hold | Question: Hagar was the mother of which of Abraham's sons?", ['ishmael'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5024'), ("Context: Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong , the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon during Apollo 11 .

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected.

Belgians were the first to experiment with fruit, adding raspberry and cherry into the mix, and today brewers have taken things even further, sweetening their suds with apples, blueberries, bananas and more.\xa0  Take a look at Gayot.com’s list of the top 10 fruit beers to find everything from tart lambics to crisp saisons to creamy strawberry beer.  1. Raspberry Redemption  Gayot.com  Joseph James Brewing Company - Henderson, NV  This microbrewery in Henderson, Nevada, is not shy about making extreme beers. Their Raspberry Redemption contains no sweet, syrupy fruit concentrate, but rather loads of the real McCoy. Eighty pounds of fresh raspberries are added during the boil. After the beer is done fermenting, it\'s transferred onto another 600 pounds of fresh raspberries, where it sits for three months, soaking up the true flavor of the fruit. Fifty pounds of Hershey\'s raw cocoa and Belgian candi sugar are also put in while the beer is cooking, which provides some sweet balance to the tartness of the true raspberry flavor of this beer. After bottling, this brew goes through a secondary fermentation, providing a natural carbonation, so this bottle-conditioned beer will have some natural yeast sediment left in the bottle after pouring.  Style: Belgian-Style Dubbel  Price: $11.99 for 750 ml  2. Lindemans Pomme  Gayot.com  Brouwerij Lindemans - Vlezenbeek, Belgium  The Lindemans brewery has its roots as a family farm with a small brewery that began the commercial brewing of lambic ales in 1811. The fruit seasoning this lambic is apple (pomme is French for apple). Long before hops were common in most beers, fruits and herbs were used as bittering agents! As with all Belgian lambics, immediately after being brewed the beer is left in vats open to the outside air, where it is fermented by a variety of wild yeasts. The yeast provides plenty of tartness, as do the fresh apples that are added during a secondary fermentation. This apple lambic pours a light golden hue with a thick foamy head of tightly packed bubbles. An aroma of sweet and sour apple dominates, which may remind you of a Sour Apple Jolly Rancher candy. A Granny Smith Apple sweet and sour flavor continues as you sip, with sweetness up front turning to tartness in the aftertaste. Unlike ciders, which tend to be overly sweet, this lambic has other complexities compliments of the yeast. This beer has a diminutive 3.5 percent alcohol content, making it easy drinking.  Style: Lambic/Fruit  Gayot.com  Lost Coast Brewery - Eureka, CA  One of the few breweries to be founded by women, Lost Coast Brewery in California\'s Humboldt Bay region began in 1986 when homebrewers Barbara Groom and Wendy Pound wondered what it would be like to open their own brewpub. From its humble beginnings, Lost Coast has grown exponentially and is now the 49th largest brewery in the U.S. and 36th largest craft brewery in the nation. This wheat beer pours a beautiful burnt orange honey color. Its aroma is anything but subtle and will remind you of a freshly peeled tangerine. Upon tasting, this beer makes a transformation, with an initial flavor delivering a mild tangerine sweetness that, after swallowing, turns into a tangy aftertaste with bitterness reminiscent of tangerine peel zest. Both flavors blend well with the combination of wheat and crystal malts and Perle finishing hops. Tangerine Wheat is one of Lost Coast\'s two fruit beer offerings, the other being its Raspberry Brown.  Style: Fruit Beer  Gayot.com  New Belgium Brewing - Fort Collins, CO  Released in 2012 as part of New Belgium Brewing\'s Lips of Faith series, this ale was crafted in honor of alternative hip hop and blues musician G.

The members of the order strive to cultivate the ideals of the order’s founder. The Franciscans actually consist of three orders. The First Order comprises priests and lay brothers who have sworn to lead a life of prayer, preaching, and penance. This First Order is divided into three independent branches: the Friars Minor (O.F.M.), the Friars Minor Conventual (O.F.M. Conv.), and the Friars Minor Capuchin (O.F.M. Cap.). The Second Order consists of cloistered nuns who belong to the Order of St. Clare (O.S.C.) and are known as Poor Clares (P.C.). The Third Order consists of religious and lay men and women who try to emulate Saint Francis’ spirit by performing works of teaching, charity, and social service. Strictly speaking, the latter order consists of the Third Order Secular , whose lay members live in the world without vows; and the Third Order Regular, whose members live in religious communities under vow. Congregations of these religious men and women are numerous all over the Roman Catholic world. The Franciscans are the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic church. They have contributed six popes to the church.  It was probably in 1207 that Francis felt the call to a life of preaching, penance, and total poverty. He was soon joined by his first followers, to whom he gave a short and simple rule of life. In 1209 he and 11 of his followers journeyed to Rome, where Francis received approval of his rule from Pope Innocent III . Under this rule, Franciscan friars could own no possessions of any kind, either individually or communally (i.e., as the property of the order as a whole). The friars wandered and preached among the people, helping the poor and the sick. They supported themselves by working and by begging food, but they were forbidden to accept money either as payment for work or as alms. The Franciscans worked at first in Umbria and then in the rest of Italy and abroad. The impact of these street preachers and especially of their founder was immense, so that within 10 years they numbered 5,000. Affiliated with them were the Franciscan nuns, whose order was founded at Assisi in 1212, by St. Clare , who was under the guidance of St. Francis. Clare and her followers were lodged by Francis in the Church of San Damiano, where they lived a severe life of total poverty. They later became known as the Poor Clares or the Order of St. Clare.  Similar Topics  Cistercian  During the first years of the Franciscans, the example of Francis provided their real rule of life, but, as the order grew, it became clear that a revised rule was necessary. After preparing a rule in 1221 that was found too strict, Francis, with the help of several legal scholars, unwillingly composed the more restrained final rule in 1223. This rule was approved by Pope Honorius III .  Even before the death of Francis in 1226, conflicts had developed within the order over the observance of the vow of complete poverty . The rapid expansion of the order’s membership had created a need for settled monastic houses, but it was impossible to justify these if Francis’ rule of complete poverty was followed strictly. Three parties gradually appeared: the Zealots , who insisted on a literal observance of the primitive rule of poverty affecting communal as well as personal poverty; the Laxists, who favoured many mitigations; and the Moderates, or the Community , who wanted a legal structure that would permit some form of communal possessions. Something of an equilibrium was reached between these different schools of thought while St. Bonaventure was minister general (1257–74). Sometimes called the second founder of the order, he provided a wise, moderate interpretation of the rule. During this period the friars spread throughout Europe, while missionaries penetrated Syria and Africa.

Did Davy Crockett Die in Battle at the Alamo?  Updated March 05, 2016.  Did Davy Crockett Die in Battle at the Alamo?:  On March 6, 1836, Mexican forces stormed the Alamo, a fortress-like old mission in San Antonio where some 200 rebellious Texans had been holed up for weeks. The battle was over in less than two hours, leaving great Texas heroes like Jim Bowie, James Butler Bonham and William Travis dead. Among the defenders that day was Davy Crockett, former Congressman and legendary hunter, scout and teller of tall-tales. According to some accounts, Crockett died in battle and according to others, he was one of a handful of men captured and later executed. What really happened?  Davy Crockett:  Davy Crockett (1786-1836) was born in Tennessee, then a frontier territory. He was a hard working young man who distinguished himself as a scout in the Creek War and provided food for his whole regiment by hunting. Initially a supporter of Andrew Jackson , he was elected to Congress in 1827. He fell out with Jackson, however, and in 1835 lost his seat in Congress.  continue reading below our video  10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don\'t Know  By this time, Crockett was famous for his tall tales and folksy speeches. He felt it was time to take a break from politics and decided to visit Texas.  Crockett Arrives at the Alamo:  Crockett made his way slowly to Texas. Along the way, he learned that there was much sympathy for the Texans in the USA. Many men were heading there to fight and people assumed Crockett was, too: he didn\'t contradict them. He crossed into Texas in early 1836. Learning that the fighting was taking place near San Antonio , he headed there. He arrived at the Alamo in February. By then, Rebel leaders such as Jim Bowie and William Travis were preparing a defense. Bowie and Travis did not get along: Crockett, ever the skilled politician, defused the tension between them.  Crockett at the Battle of the Alamo:  Crockett had arrived with a handful of volunteers from Tennessee. These frontiersmen were lethal with their long rifles and they were a welcome addition to the defenders. The Mexican army arrived in late February and laid siege to the Alamo. Mexican General Santa Anna did not immediately seal the exits from San Antonio and the defenders could have escaped had they wished: they chose to remain. The Mexicans attacked at dawn on March 6 and within two hours the Alamo was overrun .  Was Crockett taken Prisoner?:  Here’s where things get unclear. Historians agree on a few basic facts: some 600 Mexicans and 200 Texans died that day. A handful – most say seven – of Texan defenders were taken alive. These men were swiftly put to death by orders of Mexican General Santa Anna. According to some sources, Crockett was among them, and according to others, he was not. What’s the truth? There are several sources that should be considered.  Fernando Urissa:  The Mexicans were crushed at the Battle of San Jacinto about six weeks later. One of the Mexican\xa0 prisoners was a young officer named Fernando Urissa. Urissa was wounded, and treated by Dr. Nicholas Labadie, who kept a journal. Labadie asked about the Battle of the Alamo, and Urissa mentioned the capture of a "venerable-looking man" with a red face: he believed the others called him "Coket." The prisoner was brought to Santa Anna and then executed, shot by several soldiers at once.  Francisco Antonio Ruiz:  Francisco Antonio Ruiz, the mayor of San Antonio, was safely behind the Mexican lines when the battle began and had a good vantage point to witness what happened. Before the arrival of the Mexican army, he had met Crockett, as the civilians of San Antonio and the defenders of the Alamo mingled freely. He said that after the battle Santa Anna ordered him to point out the bodies of Crockett, | Question: During which battle did Davey Crockett lose his life?', ['alamo'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7332'), ("Context: `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' is a song by American recording artist Sam Cooke , released on December 22 , 1964 , by RCA Victor .

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

Traditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and HullsTraditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and Hulls  Caulking Decks and Hulls  Introduction  Caulking is defined by driving oakum, cotton or general rope fibres in the seams of a ship's wooden deck or side / hull to make it watertight. It also plays a structural role in tightening up the hull / deck of a ship and reduces the longitudinal movement of neighbouring planks.  It is very easy to demonstrate the principles behind caulking a vessel, however, it is a skill where practice is\xa0 important but also individual vessels present their own issues. Usually you will have to warm to the task, understand which iron you\xa0 have to use, and how much oakum. There is a lot in the skill that simply comes from experience and new builds present different\xa0 issues to old boats.  The final pitching of the seam was not demonstrated because it was not occurring at the time of the\xa0 demonstration.  Procedure  The process is demonstrated in the accompanying video clips with a step-by-step guide. The conversation with the boat builder, in this case, Chris Rees is unscripted and covers the technique from his experience.  The technique is very simple but the subtleties come with experience:  Clean the seam to be caulked.  Twist a length of caulking material (oakum or cotton).

They simply hypothesized that if the plasma membrane is a bi-layer , then the surface area of the mono - layer of lipids measured would be double the surface area of the plasma membrane . To examine their hypothesis , they performed an experiment in which they extracted lipids from a known number of red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) of different mammalian sources , such as humans , goats , sheep , etc. and then spreading the lipids as a mono - layer in a Langmuir - Blodgett trough . They measured the total surface area of the plasma membrane of red blood cells , and using Langmuir 's method , they measured the area of the mono - layer of lipids . In comparing the two , they calculated an estimated ratio of 2 : 1 . This supported their hypothesis , which led to the conclusion that cell membranes are composed of two apposing molecular layers . The two scientists proposed a structure for this bi-layer , with the polar hydrophilic heads facing outwards towards the aqueous environment and the hydrophobic tails facing inwards away from the aqueous surroundings on both sides of the membrane . Although they arrived at the right conclusions , some of the experimental data were incorrect such as the miscalculation of the area and pressure of the lipid mono - layer and the incompleteness of lipid extraction . They also failed to describe membrane function , and had false assumptions such as that of plasma membranes consisting of mostly lipids .

The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing "bad medicine" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle. Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years. | Question: What other reason caused poor supply of New France from a difficult winter?', ['poor harvest in 1757', 'allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot', 'poor harvest', 'a poor harvest'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10298'), ("Context: Lin - Manuel Miranda and Jordan Fisher sing a duet on `` You 're Welcome '' , which plays over the end credits .

He was shown to be physically imposing, an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism.

We want you to know what is in our food and help you make the best decisions for you and your family.\xa0  Even though the FDA, USDA, World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association have concluded that products containing genetically engineered ingredients are safe, Del Monte remains committed to meeting evolving consumer preferences and continues to explore Non-GMO ingredient alternatives where possible.  All of the fruit, vegetables and tomatoes in Del Monte products have always come from traditional breeding techniques and are not the result of any modern genetic engineering, or genetic modification (Non-GMO). 70 of our best-selling vegetable and tomato products are completely Non-GMO and can be found by looking for the Non-GMO label on the product.\xa0  Certain Del Monte products do contain added ingredients (like sweeteners or flavorings) that have been derived from genetically engineered corn or soybeans. Del Monte made a significant investment to convert these added ingredients to be Non-GMO. As a result, we plan to convert the majority of our vegetables and fruit cups and most of our tomato products to “Non-GMO” by the end of our 2016 pack season (Sept/Oct 2016).

In response to growing consumer and customer preference, we have been working closely with can manufacturers and lining suppliers to approve non-BPA internal can lining alternatives that meet both food safety and consumer quality requirements. Given the critical role in ensuring product safety and preserving quality, any replacement for BPA must first pass rigorous safety and quality testing before we will accept it for use in our products. If an alternative proves safe and effective in a particular application, we will pursue it.

The "sidekick" to Morse, Lewis is a Detective Sergeant in the Thames Valley Police, and appears in all 13 Morse novels. In the television adaptation, Inspector Morse, he is played by Kevin Whately. Following the conclusion of the series, Whately reprised the role as the lead character in Lewis, in which the character has been promoted to Inspector.  Character history  Inspector Morse (TV and novels)  Lewis is a sergeant on the staff of the Thames Valley Police in Oxford, England, and in Inspector Morse is assistant to the titular Detective Chief Inspector Morse. Although Lewis\'s given name is Robert (Robbie), he was rarely referred to as anything but "Sergeant Lewis" or "Lewis."  The background and personality of Lewis\xa0– a working class, easygoing family man with a Geordie accent (in the TV series; he is Welsh in the novels)\xa0– is frequently contrasted with that of Morse\xa0– Oxford educated, RP-accented, lifetime bachelor. Morse frequently uses these differences to insult or demean Lewis, perhaps from Morse\'s point of view in a playful manner, but Lewis is often not amused by the jabs. In his frustration, Lewis is often more in step with their joint superior Chief Superintendent Strange, himself an evident supporter of Lewis; however, despite a great respect towards Strange, Lewis is always unflinchingly loyal to Morse and follows his lead.  One notable difference between the Lewis from the novels and Whately\'s portrayal is that Lewis in the novels is an older man in his early sixties. When Whately auditioned for the role and then learned this fact, he considered it unlikely that he would get the part. However, Colin Dexter has consistently stated that the younger Lewis is an improvement on the character he originally created, and that if he could start the novels afresh he would begin with Lewis as he is seen in the television adaptation.  In Inspector Morse, Lewis is often shown following a hunch that Morse criticises, and in the end Lewis is usually proved correct, or at least more correct than Morse. Near the end of the television series, Lewis moves on in his career and takes a promotion. With the end of Inspector Morse and the death of its star, John Thaw, Lewis\'s adventures had seemed to come to an end.  In the episode "The Dead of Jericho", Lewis tells Morse "It\'s also my birthday". The first victim is killed on 11 June, and this utterance occurs a few days to a week later. This puts Lewis\' birthday in mid-June.  Lewis does not make an appearance in the episode "The Wench is Dead", as he is out of town on an inspector\'s course.  Lewis  In the pilot episode, Lewis returns to Oxford from a two-year stint training police in the British Virgin Islands, following the death of his wife Valerie in a hit-and-run accident. Lewis still must work partly in the shadow of the now-five-years-dead Inspector Morse, who some time prior to his death had worked a case involving one of the murder suspects as a juvenile. In the new series, Lewis gains his own junior, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (played by Laurence Fox), a Cambridge-educated man who joined the police after giving up training for the priesthood. Another staple of the series, pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (played by Clare Holman), appears late in the Morse series, and continues on through all of the Lewis episodes as a witty part of the team, with a cynical sense of humour and as a romantic interest to him.  The popularity of the one-off episode spurred the continuation of the story into a total of nine series comprising 33 episodes, the most recent airing in 2015. In the latest series, Lewis had retired from the police force, but is brought back as a consultant to work with Hathaway, who is now a detective inspector himself. | Question: In the Inspector Morse series what is the christian name of Sergeant Lewis\' wife ?', ['valerie'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7178'), ('Context: Chryseobacterium frigidum  Chryseobacterium frigidum is a Gram-negative, aerobic and non-motile bacteria from the genus of Chryseobacterium which has been isolated from high Arctic tundra soil near Ny-Ålesund in Norway.

Lithuania Traveller Article:  Comments (5)  Changing money in Lithuania  Lithuania has its own currency which is the Lithuanian litas (LTL). Its symbol is simply "Lt", that is usually after the amount e.g. "3,82 Lt" . Each litas consists of 100 centas. Coins go as little as 1 centas to 5 litas, while banknotes (bills) go as from 10 litas to 500 litas.\xa0  The litas has been pegged to euro at the rate of 3.4528 LTL= 1 EUR \xa0since February 2002. Euro being the official peg currency makes commercial banks to follow Lithuanian Central Bank mandate (www.lb.lt) to not exceed 0.50 percent margin in commercial transactions. Lithuania has had hopes to join the EU monetary union in 2007 so the Euro would become the currency. SEB/Vilniaus Bankas (www.seb.lt) now claims no worries about converting to Euro and puts the best forecast for 2009. Thus among notable rates of exchange, it is roughly 4 litas to the pound sterling (2011). There is limited possibity to buy Litas outside of Lithuania so you have two main ways to get your spending money:  1. Take your own local currency and change it when you arrive. Go to a bank and you will find that the cashiers will exchange your money without the need for you to enter into any explanation. Just hand over the money and back will come the Lita. Some banks have a little machine inside the door with symbols on so that you just press the \'currency exchange\' button, receive a ticket with a number on and then wait for your turn.  2. The second way to obtain some spending money is take your bank card card to an cash machines (ATM) - be it Visa, Mastercard or any plain debit card bearring Cirrus logo. The machines will offer you a choice of languages when you insert your card. Select the appropriate one and then proceed as you would at home. The machines are common in the large cities in the sort of places that you would expect to find them - outside banks and supermarkets.

Prince Charles and Princess Diana took up residence at Highgrove House soon after they were married in 1981.  "I knew I wanted to take care of the place in a very personal way and to leave it one day, in a far better condition than I found it."  HRH The Prince of Wales on Highgrove  The Duchy of Cornwall acquired Highgrove House from the MP Maurice Macmillan, son of former Tory Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1980.  The purchase added to the nation\'s speculation that the Prince was considering marriage.  Highgrove became the first home for Charles and Diana\'s young sons Princes William and Harry and they spent much of their early years on the estate prior to starting school.  Princess Diana is reported to have made many shopping trips to neighbouring Tetbury and Cirencester during her years at Highgrove and locals became used to seeing her and the young Princes out and about in the area.  Diana left Highgrove in the 1990s  Diana officially moved out of Highgrove following the breakdown of her marriage to Charles in the early 1990s.  Highgrove remains the official residence of Prince Charles. He has used the 37-acre estate to promote his interest in organic farming and gardening.  The Prince is well known for his love of nature and in his book Highgrove: Portrait of an Estate he writes: "I had absolutely no experience of gardening or farming, and the only trees I had planted had been official ones in very official holes.  "I knew I wanted to take care of the place in a very personal way and to leave it one day, in a far better condition than I found it".

Phlebotomists Duties: What Exactly does a Phlebotomist do?  written by: Victoria Trix•edited by: DaniellaNicole•updated: 1/31/2009  You may have heard the term Phlebotomist but what exactly are the duties of a Phlebotomist and what does a Phlebotomist do?  slide 1 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties  Phlebotomists duties and responsibilities center around the obtaining and proper handling of human blood. The basic services of the phlebotomist include taking blood samples from patients and correctly cataloging them for lab analysis, but the importance of the phlebotomist is far more critical than this simple description implies.  slide 2 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Critical Responsibilities  Since phlebotomists have an extremely high potential to be exposed to blood borne diseases and contaminants, the level of caution and expertise they use in the execution of their duties is critical to their own safety as well as all others that may be exposed to the fluid samples they draw. Under the direction of a physician or other licensed health care professional, phlebotomists duties includes collecting samples of blood and other fluids from patients. Prior to collection, it is the phlebotomist’s responsibility to assure that all collection instruments and environments are sterile and of first use.  After sample collection, the phlebotomists duties will include correctly labeling the collection container with pertinent patient information for identification, and subsequently must complete and file companion paperwork to trace the route of the sample from collection through lab work through final analysis and diagnosis and finally to proper disposal of the fluids. Any error in the job of a phlebotomist can have consequences that range from misdiagnosis to fatal contamination. In addition, phlebotomists on a hospital staff will also be required to train other phlebotomists in sample collection and follow up.  slide 3 of 5  Additional Phlebotomists Duties  Some phlebotomists duties, for example those that conduct home care visits, will also include being responsible for transportation of fluid samples between the sample site and the laboratory. In some cases the phlebotomists duties will also include being responsible for performing certain functions to process blood samples for further analysis by attending medical professionals.  Phlebotomists that work in a laboratory environment have the added task of ensuring that samples are correctly analyzed by enforcing quality control and safety measures to prevent the contamination of samples during analysis.  slide 4 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Education and Career  Phlebotomy training is obtained by passing a one year vocational program which is offered through technical schools or community colleges. Many community colleges also offer associate’s degree programs in phlebotomy. In addition to becoming certified as a phlebotomist, some states will require licensing or registration.  A certified phlebotomist can expect an annual salary ranging from $20,000 to $48,000, with an increase in demand for services expected through 2012. As the demand increases, more facilities will require pre-certification of phlebotomists before they are hired, to reduce the impact of liability.  Phlebotomists' duties and services are usually scheduled, rather than performed under emergency situations. Given this fact, phlebotomists usually have the benefit of shift hours that match regular office hours, which is a luxury not typically found in the medical profession.  slide 5 of 5 | Question: What does a phlebotomist usually deal with?", ['taking blood'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3552'), ('Context: Classic Rock Songs about Money and Taxes (Top 10)Classic Rock Songs about Money and Taxes  The tax man\'s taken all my dough,  And left me in my stately home,  Lazing on a sunny afternoon.

His brother was Richard Ainley (1910-1967) and his father Henry Ainley (1879-1945). He worked in the theatre for many years and eventually found work in various historical film dramas in the 1970s. However, his claim to fame is in the casting in the role of the Master in the long running science fiction series, "Doctor Who" (1963). He joined the team in 1980, appearing in at least one of every six episodes per year until 1986 - when his contract expired. However, he did reprise the role for the final Doctor Who episode entitled \'Survival\' - where the Master was supposedly killed off. He retired from acting professionally in the late nineties and played cricket up until the time of his death in May 2004.  TRIVIA:  He was a keen cricketer for many years.  By the mid-eighties, he had come into some money that allowed him to live a comfortable life without acting.  He was the fourth actor to portray the Master in "Doctor Who" (1963). The character had previously been played by \'Roger Delgado\' (qv), \'Peter Pratt\' (qv) and \'Geoffrey Beevers\' (qv).  He played the Master in \'Doctor Who\' for nine years - the longest serving actor to appear as a regular character in the TV series\' history.  He was on the shortlist for Prof Watson (played by Glyn Houston) in Doctor Who: The Hand of Fear.  Just as his Doctor Who character "The Master" would use anagrams to conceal his identity, Ainley would be credited with an anagram of his own name to hide the fact that a character he was playing in certain episodes was The Master in Disguise. Most notably, this led to his credit in "Castrovalva" episode 3 being "Neil Toynay" (Tony Ainley).  After \'Roger Delgado\' (qv), \'Peter Pratt\' (qv) and \'Geoffrey Beevers\' (qv), he was the fourth actor to play the Master, the Doctor\'s greatest enemy, in _"Doctor Who" (1963)_ (qv).

The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former, but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, for their part, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain, which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, also gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, from France in compensation for its losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations. | Question: Why did France choose to give up continental lands?", ["value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent", "They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent", "value of the Caribbean islands' sugar", "They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater"], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10502'), ('Context: Full text of "The romantic story of the Highland garb and ...Full text of "The romantic story of the Highland garb and the tartan"  See other formats  THE ROMANTIC STORY     HIGHLAND GARB AND THE TARTAN     THE ROMANTIC STORY     HIGHLAND GARB     AND THE     TARTAN     vUHMOaD/JVI aiAQBAJA jaMOJOD   J.

The song reaches its peak in the chorus , revealing that he indeed stopped loving her when he died and the woman does return -- for his funeral . In a different singer 's hands , the song might have sounded irreverent but Jones ' interpretation , buoyed by his delivery of the line `` ... first time I 'd seen him smile in years '' , gives it a realism . | Question: who wrote the song he stopped loving her today ?", ['Curly Putman', 'Bobby Braddock'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-2630'), ("Context: Less than 75 years after the discovery of gold in 1848 , almost every grizzly bear in California had been tracked down and killed .

Lord Scarman was appointed by then Home Secretary William Whitelaw on 14 April 1981 (two days after the rioting ended) to hold the enquiry into the riots.  The Scarman report was published on November 25, 1981.   The terms of reference for the enquiry were "to inquire urgently into the serious disorder in Brixton on 10–12 April 1981 and to report, with the power to make recommendations".  The 1981 Brixton riots   The riot took place in Brixton, London on 11 April 1981. At the time when Brixton underwent deep social and economic problems — high unemployment, high crime, poor housing, no amenities — in a predominantly African-Caribbean community.  The Metropolitan Police began Operation Swamp 81 at the beginning of April, aimed at reducing street crime, mainly through the heavy use of the so-called sus law, which allowed police to stop and search (and ultimately jail) individuals on the basis of a mere \'suspicion\' of wrongdoing. Plain clothes police officers were dispatched into Brixton, and in five days almost 1,000 people were stopped and searched.  The riot resulted in 299 injuries to police and 65 injuries to members of the public; over a hundred vehicles were burned, including 56 police vehicles; and almost 150 buildings were damaged, with 28 burned. There were 82 arrests. Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved in the riot.   Evidence   As part of the inquiry the following individuals and groups gave evidence: The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (Counsel - Mr J Hazan QC and Mr L Marshall Concern), the Council for Community Relations of Lambeth, London Borough of Lambeth, Brixton local community groups and clubs, the Brixton Legal Defence Group, and the Commission for Racial Equality.  Findings and recommendations   According to the Scarman report, the riots were a spontaneous outburst of built-up resentment sparked by particular incidents. Lord Scarman stated that "complex political, social and economic factors" created a "disposition towards violent protest". The Scarman report highlighted problems of racial disadvantage and inner city decline, warning that "urgent action" was needed to prevent racial disadvantage becoming an "endemic, ineradicable disease threatening the very survival of our society".  Scarman found unquestionable evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of \'stop and search\' powers by the police against black people. The report details the use of arbitrary roadblocks, the stopping and searching of pedestrians and mass detention (943 stops, 118 arrests and 75 charges). Operation Swamp 81 was conducted by the police without any consultation with the community or the home-beat officers.  Liaison arrangements between police, community and local authority had collapsed before the riots and according to the Scarman report, the local community mistrusted the police and their methods of policing. Scarman recommended changes in training and law enforcement, and the recruitment of more ethnic minorities into the police force. According to the report "institutional racism" did not exist, but positive discrimination to tackle racial disadvantage was "a price worth paying".  Reception   The theme of the Scarman report was broadly welcomed, accepted and endorsed by politicians, police commissioners, the press and community relations officials. Some of the report\'s recommendations were implemented. "Hard policing" continued and new measures were taken to create greater public trust and confidence in official institutions. Multi-agency and "soft" policing emerged through community consultation, youth and "race relations" services.   The Scarman report pushed the issue of law and order, and specifically policing, onto the mainstream agenda. The debate in the House of Parliament to mark the publication of the Scarman report on the 26 November 1981 had as its theme "law and order" and the then leader of the Liberal Party, David Steel, argued that "urgent action" to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary.

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.  On the 24th April 1567, Mary was kidnapped by Bothwell (it is | Question: What was the name of the letters that in 1566 implicated Mary Queen of Scots in the murder of her second husband, Lord Darnley?', ['casket letters'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1935'), ("Context: Fenestrated capillaries ( derived from fenestra , Latin for `` window '' ) have pores in the endothelial cells ( 60 -- 80 nm in diameter ) that are spanned by a diaphragm of radially oriented fibrils and allow small molecules and limited amounts of protein to diffuse .

Third host Les Dennis with Mr.Babbage  As Paul Merton said in Have I Got News for You - "they\'ll get asked to name something with a motor in it and they\'ll say something like... \'a cat\' " and it was so true!  100 people were polled on a innocuous question such as Name something you do in bed, and a person from each family hit a buzzer and guessed as to what the public might have said.  The buzz-off for control of the board  If it wasn\'t the top answer then the opposing team were allowed to guess. Whoever had the most popular answer got to take the question for their team (they could pass it if they wanted, but that was a rare occurrence). The rest of the family then took it in turns to guess answers until they got three incorrect guesses (as represented by a cross and a UH-UHHHHH! sound).  The game board  If the opposing team then guessed an answer not yet found they won the money (a pound for every person that replied to that answer). If not, any found money went to the first team.  After the break they played for Double Money. You\'re probably intelligent enough to guess what happened there.  The set as seen in 1999  The family who first made £300 went through to the final round where the excitement peaked (apparently) when the family with the most points selected two members of the family to play a fast money game against the clock- yes, it was time for Biiiig Money! (At least, Max Bygraves enjoyed whipping it up in that way, but the other hosts didn\'t tend to make such a big deal of it, except for reminding the contestants of the money - and possibly car or holiday - they could win).  A contestant plays the end game  It was a nice gentle show with a lot of humour in it, and there was some evolution of the format near the end - particularly the chance to win a car (and later a holiday) if you found all five top answers in the end game. But as the millennium approached we thought couldn\'t ITV be a bit braver and try something new for a change instead of cranking out yet another series? Come in number 5, your time is up.  Then, in 2002, the show moved to daytime. Les Dennis left, knowing that this was going to be the final nail in the coffin for the show, and the oh-so-famous Andy Collins became the new host.

This newly modified version was probably a response to poor sales of the \'Standard\' the previous year, which may in turn have been due to the rising popularity of the more streamlined Stratocaster.

Les Paul apparently didn\'t like the design which is not surprising, as the SG lacks the \'pizzazz\' of earlier models such as the \'Gold\', as the SG has quite a plain aesthetic red finish.  His distaste for the new version went so far as him asking for his name to be removed form the guitar, hence why it is called the \'SG\'.  Most SGs have a solid mahogany body and neck, and the traditional combination of bridge and pickup set up.  In line with Gibson\'s policy of appealing to as many players as possible, they released three versions; the Junior, the Standard, and the Custom, appealing to varying levels of playing experience and wallet sizes.   The model was a success, and over the years Gibson has expanded this very popular range with modifications, reissues, and special editions.  When the sub-company Epiphone launched, it released a cheaper version of the SG, which was due to savings made by cutting down on costs for materials, incorporating less features, and hence, it is seen as an inferior model. Pick-guards on the standard were experimented with over the years, until in 1972 when Gibson went back to the original design which seems like a lot of time wasted, but then again that\'s Gibson, they are willing to take a chance by putting it out there, and finding out what people think - the customer is always right! They had tried the larger \'Batwing\', but it didn\'t prove to be very popular.  Vibrato (tremolo arm) tailpieces were also introduced as options, although more recent reissues have gone back to the pre-dated versions.  One highly innovative modification was the introduction of a motorized tuning system in the 2008 released Robot SG.  This invention is obviously a boon for guitarists, especially ones in bands with other members who will even whine that the keyboard is out of tune, never mind the guitar (no joking, anyone who\'s been in a band will have experienced this type of idiocy/egomaniac behaviour).  But, as this technology comes with a pretty heavy price tag, it hasn\'t been adopted on standard guitars.  Eric Clapton\'s SG standard, the "Fool", named after the artist who \'decorated it\', was sold for half a million dollars, previously it had also been owned by Todd Rundgren who had bought it for five hundred dollars.  The SG has always been a favourite of heavy Metal guitarists such as Angus Young of AC/DC, and Tony Lommi of Black Sabbath, although Frank Zappa was also an SG player.  While the internals of the earlier Les Paul and the SG are pretty much the same, it\'s the body that separates them and the differing levels of playability due the specific neck that both models offer.  The SG has been so popular that it is still in production today, and there are no signs of its popularity waning.

It was cute and sweet and bouncy. It was tuneful and ingenuous." It was also, according to Cliff Richard, who took it to number one in the U.K. in 1959, "chronic. "Living Doll" changed the whole course of my career. I parted company with the greasy-haired rock & rollers and began attracting the mums. And that\'s how it stayed."  Originally written for singer Duffy Power, before it was transplanted into Richard\'s movie debut, Serious Charge, the song was, ironically, initially envisioned as an up-tempo light rocker and appears as such in the movie. It was only when producer Norrie Paramor suggested it become Richard\'s next single that the singer insisted on rearranging it into the now familiar form. He later revealed that he hated the fast version even more than he loathed the slow one.  Either way, it was a wise decision. "Living Doll" topped the U.K. chart, Richard\'s first British number one, with sales in excess of a million. It also became his first U.S. hit, reaching number 30 that fall. Today, it remains one of Richard\'s most instantly recognizable numbers, courtesy also of an anarchic revival he undertook in 1986 with the comedy troupe the Young Ones. Recorded in aid of the Comic Relief charity, this version, too, topped the British chart.  Appears On  Living Doll by Cliff Richard SongfactsLiving Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Living Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Songfacts  This song was from the soundtrack to the film Serious Charge, which was Cliff Richard\'s movie debut. It was written by Lionel Bart who also wrote the West End and Broadway musical Oliver. It was originally intended for the singer Duffy Power before it was included in Serious Charge.  This was originally a Rock song, and as both Cliff and his backing band thought that a song about a blow-up doll was uncool, they originally weren\'t planning to record it. One of his backing musicians, Bruce Welch, suggested a slower tempo like a country song would work better, so they rearranged it into the now familiar form.  According to 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, Lionel Bart said, "I had taken it from one of those ads in the Sunday papers for a doll that did everything and I wrote it in 10 minutes flat."  In the UK, this was the biggest-selling single of 1959.  In 1986 Cliff did a humorous, anarchic re-recording of this for BBC\'s charity appeal Comic Relief. It featured the cast of BBC\'s comedy Young Ones series, which were Rik Mayall (Rick), Adrian Edmonson (Vyvyan), Nigel Planer (Neil) and Christopher Ryan (Mike). When it topped the UK chart Cliff became the first artist to have the same song in two different versions at number one. >>  Suggestion credit:  Edward Pearce - Ashford, Kent, England, for all above  This was the first of Cliff Richard 14 UK chart-toppers.

The brothers thought the combination of these things `` was the best thing ever '' . To introduce this monster into the narrative , they considered `` bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War '' such as Project MKUltra , which gave a way to ground the monster 's existence in science rather than something spiritual . This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period , as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out , which focused on Cold War paranoia . Subsequently , they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s , the decade they were born , as elements of the series , crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror .

Beside supplying materials , Chinese cadres also pressured the Vietnamese Communist Party , then under First Secretary Trường Chinh , to emulate their brand of revolution , unleashing a purge of `` bourgeois and feudal '' elements from the Viet Minh ranks , carrying out a ruthless and bloody land reform campaign ( Cải Cách Ruộng Đất ) , and denouncing `` bourgeois and feudal '' tendencies in arts and literature . Many true patriots and devoted Communist revolutionaries in the Viet Minh suffered mistreatment or were even executed during these movements . Many others became disenchanted and left the Viet Minh .

At birth , the baby 's lungs are filled with lung liquid , which is distinct from amniotic fluid . When the newborn is expelled from the birth canal , its central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment . This triggers it to take the first breath , within about 10 seconds after delivery . With the first breaths , there is a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance , and an increase in the surface area available for gas exchange . Over the next 30 seconds the pulmonary blood flow increases and is oxygenated as it flows through the alveoli of the lungs . Oxygenated blood now reaches the left atrium and ventricle , and through the descending aorta reaches the umbilical arteries . Oxygenated blood now stimulates constriction of the umbilical arteries resulting in a reduction in placental blood flow . As the pulmonary circulation increases there is an equivalent reduction in the placental blood flow which normally ceases completely after about three minutes . These two changes result in a rapid redirection of blood flow into the pulmonary vascular bed , from approximately 4 % to 100 % of cardiac output . The increase in pulmonary venous return results in left atrial pressure being slightly higher than right atrial pressure , which closes the foramen ovale .

The curse is so powerful that it can even torture a person to the point that they are exhausted to death , or in a more sadistic case , it causes permanent amnesia and insanity ( the case of Neville 's parents , who were tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange ) . Effective casting requires the caster to have sadistic desires . Harry finds out in Order of the Phoenix while attempting to use the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix that the caster must truly want their victim to suffer for the spell to work , and that his righteous anger is not enough . The curse , when summoned , is shown in a bright - faded blue light ( though it is usually invisible or even a red bolt of light in the films ) . When Hogwarts was under Death Eater control , the Dark Arts teacher forced the students in his class to use the Cruciatus Curse on students who had been assigned detention .   Imperio , the Imperius Curse . The curse is used for mind control or hypnosis and can force the victim to do things he / she would be unwilling to do or even incapable of under normal circumstances . The strength ( and also the duration ) of the curse is determined by the determination of the person who cast it , as well as by the level of resistance of the victim .

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the "10 million dollar millionaires" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world\'s population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world\'s wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population\'s wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016.

Oxfam\'s claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam\'s data, considers the criticism about debt to be a "silly argument" and "a non-issue . . . a diversion." | Question: What has caused Oxfam\'s findings to be questioned?', ['"silly argument" and "a non-issue . . . a diversion."', 'basis of the methodology', 'basis of the methodology used', 'the methodology used'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-7554'), ('Context: Nissan released the Datsun 280Z model for the U.S. market in the 1975 model year .

Olivier Py\'s staging, a coproduction with La Monnaie in Brussels, had its French premiere on March 14 at Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg, conducted by Daniele Callegari.  Py believes in this sprawling five-act opera, wholeheartedly embracing the work\'s libretto and its religious confrontation between Huguenots and Catholics. Pierre-André Weitz\'s raked metallic stage relied on strong lighting to make its points and was more evocative of a Py\xad–Weitz production than of any anecdotal historical backdrop. There were plenty of the director\'s familiar mannerisms to love or hate, including gratuitous nudity and an awkward exploration of physicality that would no doubt have surprised Meyerbeer and his librettist. Py is a consummate professional, however: it would be hard to imagine another director who could bring such playful dramatic energy to the work. The only added symbol, which could have been left to the audience\'s imagination, was the Holocaust reference at the moment of the final massacre of the Protestants.  The opera was composed in 1836, just seven years after Rossini\'s Guillaume Tell, and is a fascinating musical bridge between Rossini and the works of Verdi and Wagner. Verdi admired Meyerbeer, and there are rumbustious rataplan echoes in La Forza del Destino. Like Verdi, Meyerbeer writes music that blossoms from the workaday into the sublime, notably in the great Act IV duet between Valentine and Raoul. There are some clumsy musical effects, but Meyerbeer\'s striving for dramatic verisimilitude and grandeur is irresistibly forward-looking. Wagner could not have been insensitive to the fact that the musical driving force of the work is a prototype of a leitmotif, the Huguenot chorale "Ein\' feste Burg ist unser Gott" (A mighty fortress is our God).  One of the reasons for the scarcity of Huguenots revivals is the difficulty of the central tenor role, Raoul de Nangis— a part that was the property of Jean de Reszke, Caruso, Martinelli and Corelli. Initially, Gregory Kunde sounded defeated by the exposed "Plus blanche que la blanche hermine," accompanied by just a viola d\'amore, but he triumphed in the more dramatic music, singing tirelessly in commendably clear French. He was especially fine in duet with Mireille Delunsch\'s Valentine. Meyerbeer may stretch Delunsch\'s soprano resources, but she is a moving artist who brought a touching integrity to the role.\xa0  The best singing of the evening came from Karine Deshayes as the page Urbain; the French mezzo offered exemplary playful attack, perfect diction and exultant virtuosity. American soprano Laura Aikin was not far behind in terms of technical precision as Marguerite de Valois, a role that disappointingly fades away in Meyerbeer\'s opera. "Ô beau pays de la Touraine" was effortlessly dispatched, although a little less vocal discretion might have brought the house down. The great humanitarian outpourings of Raoul\'s servant Marcel were delivered with smooth bass tone by Wojtek Smilek in rather curious French, unlike that of baritone Marc Barrard, as the Comte de Nevers, whose diction and style remain impeccable. Philippe Rouillon\'s straight-voiced baritone rode over the orchestra with implacable force as Comte de Saint-Bris, while his two tenor sons, Xavier and Arnaud, creditably took on the roles of Cossé and Retz.\xa0  Callegari conducted the marathon four and a half hours with growing authority after some rocky ensemble at the beginning of the evening. This was not the subtlest of readings, but it was one with its heart in the right place, with a correct singer-friendly balance. With lusty singing from the Strasbourg chorus and some fine brass in the orchestra, the work moved forward with irresistible force and a typical Gallic mix of humor and tragedy.\xa0  \xa0  The Huguenots - Meyerbeer - Music With EaseThe Huguenots - Meyerbeer  The Huguenots  (French title: Les Huguenots)  An Opera by Jakob Meyerbeer  This opera was first produced at the Académie, Paris, on February 29, 1836 | Question: Who composed the opera The Huguenots?', ['meyerbeer'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5580'), ('Context: Most consumer inkjet printers , such as those made by Canon , HP , and Lexmark ( but not Epson ) use a thermal inkjet ; inside each partition of the ink reservoir is a heating element with a tiny metal plate or resistor .

Mythology, propaganda, Liz Taylor and the real Queen of the Nile  The Egyptian queen frequently surrounded herself with splendor, but luxury was less an indulgence than a political tool. ("Anthony and Cleopatra" by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1885)  smithsonian.com  March 31, 2007  The struggle with her teenage brother over the throne of Egypt was not going as well as Cleopatra VII had hoped. In 49 B.C., Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII—also her husband and, by the terms of their father\'s will, her co-ruler—had driven his sister from the palace at Alexandria after Cleopatra attempted to make herself the sole sovereign. The queen, then in her early twenties, fled to Syria and returned with a mercenary army, setting up camp just outside the capital.  Related Books  Rehabilitating Cleopatra  Meanwhile, pursuing a military rival who had fled to Egypt, the Roman general Julius Caesar arrived at Alexandria in the summer of 48 B.C., and found himself drawn into the Egyptian family feud. For decades Egypt had been a subservient ally to Rome, and preserving the stability of the Nile Valley, with its great agricultural wealth, was in Rome\'s economic interest. Caesar took up residence at Alexandria\'s royal palace and summoned the warring siblings for a peace conference, which he planned to arbitrate. But Ptolemy XIII\'s forces barred the return of the king\'s sister to Alexandria. Aware that Caesar\'s diplomatic intervention could help her regain the throne, Cleopatra hatched a scheme to sneak herself into the palace for an audience with Caesar. She persuaded her servant Apollodoros to wrap her in a carpet (or, according to some sources, a sack used for storing bedclothes), which he then presented to the 52-year old Roman.  The image of young Cleopatra tumbling out of an unfurled carpet has been dramatized in nearly every film about her, from the silent era to a 1999 TV miniseries, but it was also a key scene in the real Cleopatra\'s staging of her own life. "She was clearly using all her talents from the moment she arrived on the world stage before Caesar," says Egyptologist Joann Fletcher, author of a forthcoming biography, Cleopatra the Great.  Cleopatra and Ceasar by Jean-Léon Gérôme portrays the scene in which Cleopatra emerges from the carpet—probably somewhat disheveled, but dressed in her best finery—and begs Caesar for aid, the gesture that won over Rome\'s future dictator-for-life. With his help Cleopatra regained Egypt\'s throne. ( Image Source: Wikimedia Commons )  Cleopatra\'s suicide has fascinated artists for millennia, although her cause of death may have been poison rather than snakebite as is depicted in The Death of Cleopatra by Reginald Arthur (1892). ( Image Source: Wikimedia Commons )  In 1963, Cleopatra took on yet another image when Elizabeth Taylor played the part opposite Richard Burton as Mark Antony and Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar in the movie Cleopatra. ( Image Source: Wikipedia )  Dated to 32 B.C., this coin bearing a portrait of Cleopatra has renewed the debate over whether she was actually beautiful. It\'s an irrelevant question, says biographer Joann Fletcher. "The impact she made on the ancient world is overlooked, because the world has this obsession when it comes to women. People can only judge them on whether they were beautiful. Nobody ever said, \'Mark Antony: how handsome was he?\'" (Courtesy of Newcastle University, U.K.) (Portrait of a Queen)  The Egyptian queen frequently surrounded herself with splendor, but luxury was less an indulgence than a political tool.

Harpo’s main musical focus was the                                      harp (from which he derived his nickname), Chico was an excellent pianist,                                      and Groucho played the guitar. In 1905, Groucho made his debut as a                                      singer in vaudeville. By 1907 he and Gummo were singing together as                                      part of The Three Nighingales with Mabel O’Donnell. The next year,                                      Harpo became the fourth Nightingale. By 1910, the group expanded to                                      include their mother, Minnie, and their Aunt Hannah; the troupe was                                      renamed The Six Mascots.  Slowly, the group’s act evolved from singing                                      to a comedy with some music. By 1912, Chico had joined the group. Nevertheless,                                      around this time, Gummo left the group to fight in World War I; Zeppo                                      would replace him for their final vaudeville years.  During World War I, the brothers changed their stage                                      name to “The Four Marx Brothers” (including Chico, Harpo,                                      Groucho, and Zeppo). By 1919, they were playing the most famous venue                                      in vaudeville, the Palace Theatre in New York City. They also began                                      to develop their famous on-stage personas. Groucho began to wear his trademark greasepaint moustache and to use a stooped walk, Harpo began                                      to wear a red fright wig, carried a taxi-cab horn and never spoke, Chico                                      started to talk in a fake Italian accent, and Zeppo adopted the schleppy,                                      juvenile role of the straight man.  The Marx Brothers made their next claim to fame, by                                      becoming successful stars on Broadway. Their first musical revue, I’ll                                        Say She Is, debuted in 1924. A year later they followed up with                                      the musical comedy, The Cocoanuts and then in 1928 with Animal                                        Crackers.  The brothers next struck a contract with Paramount                                      Pictures and embarked on their career in films. Their first two films                                      were adaptation of their former Broadway shows: The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930). In 1931, they made a short                                      film, The House That Shadows Built, which was included in Paramount’s                                      twentieth anniversary documentary. In 1932, the brothers filmed Horse                                        Feathers, their most popular film to date, and the film which won                                      them the cover of Time magazine. Their last Paramount film, Duck                                        Soup (1933), is the only Marx Brothers film on the American Film                                      Institute’s “100 years… 100 Movies” list. The                                      team left Paramount due to creative disagreements and financial issues.  The Marx Brothers in action  After                                      Zeppo left the act to become an agent, the three remaining brothers                                      moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Under the leadership of Irving Thalberg,                                      the team changed their formula; stronger plots, more musical numbers,                                      and using the brothers' characters as comic foils to serious romance.                                      The first film that the Marx Brothers shot with MGM was A Night at                                        the Opera (1935); the film was a great success, and for many years                                      considered their best work. It was followed two years later by the even                                      bigger hit A Day at the Races (1937). The Marx Brothers made                                      three more films before leaving MGM, At the Circus (1939), Go                                        West (1940), and The Big Store (1941).  Although the brothers seemed ready to retire, Chico                                      was in dire financial straits and to help settle his gambling debts,                                      the group made another two films, A Night in Casablanca (1946)                                      and Love Happy (1949), both of them released by United Artists.                                      In 1959, they did a television special, The Incredible Jewel Robbery.  Chico and Harpo went on to make nightclub and casino                                      appearances, sometimes together.

She also really liked dudes.  In her 79 years of life, she had eight marriages with seven different men. Her mates included hotel heirs, construction workers, politicians and fellow actors. But they weren’t created equal.  So instead of revisiting Elizabeth Taylor’s many men in chronological order, we’ve ranked them by awesomeness and how their respective unions have stood the test of time. Let’s begin…  7. Michael Todd (1957-1958)  Poor Michael. Having fathered one of Liz’s four children should spare him from being in last place, but, alas, he’s the only husband of Taylor’s who exited the marriage by dying. Little more than a year after their 1957 wedding, his unfortunately-titled plane, “Lucky Liz,” crashed in New Mexico, killing him and three other passengers.  6. Michael Wilding (1952-1957)  A British actor who gave Liz her two sons, Michael and Christopher, Wilding seemed to exist solely in the shadow of his wife. His IMDB profile certainly pales in comparison.  5. Conrad\xa0 Hilton Jr. (1950-1951)  You never forget your first. Hilton may have marked Liz’s shortest marriage, but that makes him no less of a pioneer. Also? His dad was briefly a character on “Mad Men.”  4. John Warner (1976-1982)  One of just two Liz exes to survive her, Warner was the thinking man’s Mr. Taylor. He served in World War II, held the title of Secretary of the Navy and for the last three years of their marriage, he was a United States Senator — a title he held until his retirement in 2009.  3. Eddie Fisher (1959-1964)  You’ve got to hand it to Eddie just for guts he had in becoming husband #4 to Liz. Not only was the famous singer the best friend of newly-deceased Michael Todd, he left his wife Debbie Reynolds to marry her. Their union wasn’t what you would call “well-received.”  2.

Results 1 to 4 of 4  38,592  Scientific Adjectives  If you want to impress somebody who is a scientist, you need to learn how to use scientific adjectives.  For example, as Sir J. Barrow said, “The shoulders, body, things, and mane are equine; the head completely bovine“.   That should turn the head and gain the admiration of any self-respecting scientist.  The English language is remarkable in having coopted both Greek and Latin in providing adjectives that ascribe specific states.  For example, instead of saying horse-like behavior, you say “equine“ behavior.    Equine comes from the latin word equinus and the french word equus, meaning to resemble a horse, of or belonging to the family Equide.  Bovine of course means of or pertaining to the genus Bos, relating to or resembling the ox or cow, ox-like.  Many zoonic (pertaining to animals) adjectives are well-known and used.  For example, avian and canine of course stand for bird-like and dog-like respectively.  Everybody knows that elephantine and serpentine mean to be elephant-like and serpent-like respectively.  Some may even know that to be porcine is to be pig-like.  Many can probably guess that to be asinine is to be ass-like.  And some may remember that ursa major refers to the big bear in the sky and therefore ursine means bear-like.  What are less commonly used zoonic adjectives?  If you use the following words, you may get approving glances from scientists.  The adjective for mouse is murine.  This word also can refer to rats but, if you say murine antibodies, you are talking about antibodies from mouse.  Cervine is deer-like; lupine is wolf-like (anybody who has read Harry Potter knows this), vulpine is fox-like; selachian refers to sharks, rays, and skates; leporine refers to rabbits or hares; and pavonine refers to peacocks.  The word corvine refers to crows and the word raven itself means rapacity. Anserine is to be gooselike.  And, ovine is sheep-like.  There is web site called Phrontistery (meaning a thinking place) where somebody has compiled perhaps the longest list of relational adjectives starting with abbatial (relating to abbots or abbey) and ending with zymotic (relating to fermentation).  From this list, there are many additional species adjectives (excellent for scrabble games and intimate postprandial conversations).

Until this point the IRB (International Rugby Board,         the governing body of rugby union) had been         dominated by worthy English gentlemen who adhered         implacably to their cherished amateur principles.         But as the demands on top players grew, increased         media attention, amount of training required etc.         increased pressure on the IRB. The Southern         Hemisphere unions in particular, pressurized the IRB         to allow player payments.  Along with this was an ever-increasing degree of         sham-amateurism. While straight payments may not         have been openly accepted, it was obvious that top         players in some countries received various benefits         and perks from playing the game e.g. through player         trust funds, through direct under-the-table cash         payments or other roundabout methods.  The IRB finally capitulated to the inevitable and in         August 1995 rugby union became fully professional.  Philippe Sella (France) plays his last international         against England.
