{"input": "Context: The film is set in Los Angeles in the then - future of 1996 . Harley Davidson ( Mickey Rourke ) , dressed in biker gear , with ultra-short dyed hair , hears from the radio about a dangerous new street drug named `` Crystal Dream '' . ( The significance of this street drug does not become clear until later . ) Harley goes into a rough bar and sees a cowboy - looking fellow ( Don Johnson wearing a beard , cowboy hat and boots ) . He has scammed a fellow in a pool game but has to use strong measures when the fellow refuses payment . Harley helps him in this . We learn that they are old friends ( later we learn the name he goes by is The Marlboro Man . ) They visit a blues ( old jazz ? ) bar in Burbank , which they both hold special . They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels , an extremely - heavily - muscled lad , who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over a woman . After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley . Marlboro borrows Harley 's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop , with interesting results . In a bit of psychological revelation , we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with a beautiful woman , who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man , as she is not getting enough loving from him . He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank . Showing considerable balls , Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually - fascinating airplane graveyard , but then the bank 's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty , although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money . In a running battle , Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily - declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank . The closing scene : Marlboro has gone back to rodeo bull - riding and Harley on his bike takes to the road , stopping only temporarily to pick up a ravishing and shapely hitchhiker who tells him she is going `` no place special '' , a destination that Harley promises to take her .

Lou Ferrigno ( seasons 3 -- 9 ; himself ) is the actor known for his role as The Incredible Hulk . Ferrigno and his wife are neighbors of the Heffernans .

Rumblings that a ticket sale for the show would take place there started a line of people that grew during the night and into the early morning of April 1 . Then , during the morning , the announcement came that the rumors were true and tickets for the club show would go on sale at 12 pm at the Tower Records building . They charged a $10 `` retro '' ticket price for the show . Later in the evening , as the band took the stage at the Troubadour , it was revealed that Melissa Reese , who has previously worked with former drummer Bryan `` Brain '' Mantia on several projects , had replaced longtime second keyboardist Chris Pitman for the tour . During the show at the Troubadour , Rose fell and broke his foot .

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi .

Giorno attempts to steal Koichi 's luggage , but is stopped by Koichi 's Stand , Echoes Act Three . Giorno recognized his power as being a Stand power similar to his Gold Experience , a Stand that can give life to inanimate objects . The story then follows Giorno as he tries to become a boss of the mafia in order to make Naples a better place and help its people , specifically where availability of drugs to young people are concerned . After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka , he attempts to join Passione , an organized crime group that employs many Stand users ( essentially , his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood 's band , in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader ) . He is approached by a member of Passione , Bruno Bucciarati , who suspects him of killing Luka . During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati 's Stand , Sticky Fingers , that can place and open a zipper on any surface .

Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor .

These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region . This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999 ) .

Some investigators have supposed that its invention was first created by tying large leaves to bough - like ribs ( the branching out parts of an umbrella ) . Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent , which remains in an unaltered form to the present day . However , the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air , hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high - ranking ( though not necessarily royalty ) in China . On at least one occasion , twenty - four umbrellas were carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting . The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun . The Chinese design was later brought to Japan via Korea and also introduced to Persia and the Western world via the Silk Road .
