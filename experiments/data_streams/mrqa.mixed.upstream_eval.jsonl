The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( ~ 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . | Question: in what ways did farmers damage the soil during the dust bowl ?", "output": ["farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds"]}

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-84087", "input": "Context: In the human digestive system , food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication ( chewing ) , a form of mechanical digestion , and the wetting contact of saliva . Saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food ; the saliva also contains mucus , which lubricates the food , and hydrogen carbonate , which provides the ideal conditions of pH ( alkaline ) for amylase to work . After undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus . It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis . Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion . Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin . As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall , mucus is secreted by the stomach , providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals . At the same time protein digestion is occurring , mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-14751", "input": "Context: Pepsin is most active in acidic environments between 37 \u00b0 C and 42 \u00b0 C. Accordingly , its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach ( pH 1.5 to 2 ) . Pepsin will digest up to 20 % of ingested amide bonds by cleaving preferentially at the C - terminal side of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine , tryptophan , and tyrosine . Pepsin exhibits preferential cleavage for hydrophobic , preferably aromatic , residues in P1 and P1 ' positions . Increased susceptibility to hydrolysis occurs if there is a sulfur - containing amino acid close to the peptide bond , which has an aromatic amino acid . Pepsin cleaves Phe Val , Gln His , Glu Ala , Ala Leu , Leu Tyr , Tyr Leu , Gly Phe , Phe in the insulin B chain . Pepsin exhibits maximal activity at pH 2.0 and is inactive at pH 6.5 and above , however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until pH 8.0 . Therefore , pepsin in solution of up to pH 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification . The stability of pepsin at high pH has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux . Pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event . At the mean pH of the laryngopharynx ( pH = 6.8 ) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues . | Question: where is pepsin most active in the body ?", "output": ["stomach"]}

There can be considerable variation in body water percentage based on a number of factors like age , health , weight , and sex . In a large study of adults of all ages and both sexes , the adult human body averaged ~ 65 % water . However , this varied substantially by age , sex , and adiposity ( amount of fat in body composition ) .

Chinese immigrants in the 19th century worked as laborers , particularly on the transcontinental railroad , such as the Central Pacific Railroad . They also worked as laborers in the mining industry , and suffered racial discrimination at every level of society . While industrial employers were eager to get this new and cheap labor , the ordinary white public was stirred to anger by the presence of this `` yellow peril '' . Despite the provisions for equal treatment of Chinese immigrants in the 1868 Burlingame Treaty , political and labor organizations rallied against the immigration of what they regarded as a degraded race and `` cheap Chinese labor '' . Newspapers condemned the policies of employers , and even church leaders denounced the entrance of these aliens into what was regarded as a land for whites only . So hostile was the opposition that in 1882 the United States Congress eventually passed the Chinese Exclusion Act , which prohibited immigration from China for the next ten years . This law was then extended by the Geary Act in 1892 . The Chinese Exclusion Act was the only U.S. law ever to prevent immigration and naturalization on the basis of race . These laws not only prevented new immigration but also brought additional suffering as they prevented the reunion of the families of thousands of Chinese men already living in the United States ( that is , men who had left China without their wives and children ) ; anti-miscegenation laws in many states prohibited the Chinese men from marrying white women . | Question: which group immigrated to the united states to work on the transcontinental railroads ?", "output": ["Chinese"]}

Modern SMS text messaging is usually messaging from one mobile phone to another mobile phone . Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person - to - person SMS text messaging service in 1994 . When Radiolinja 's domestic competitor , Telecom Finland ( now part of TeliaSonera ) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality , Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis . GSM was allowed in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US `` Carriers '' to use US technology . Hence there is no `` development '' in the US in mobile messaging service . The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for private communication services ( PCS ) -- what the ITU frequency r\u00e9gime had blocked for DECT -- Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications -- 1000 - feet range picocell , but survived . American Personal Communications ( APC ) , the first GSM carrier in America , provided the first text - messaging service in the United States . Sprint Telecommunications Venture , a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three large cable - TV companies , owned 49 percent of APC . The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government - run spectrum auction that raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses . APC operated under the brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on November 15 , 1995 in Washington , D.C. and in Baltimore , Maryland .

The annexation of the Republic of Texas in 1845 led directly to the Mexican - American War , after which the victorious United States obtained Mexico 's northwestern quarter , including what was quickly made the state of California . However , as the development of the country moved west , the question of slavery became too much to ignore , as there was a struggle to keep the number of northern abolitionist states equal to the number of southern slave states , with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the Missouri Compromise and Bleeding Kansas . This came to a head in 1860 and 1861 , when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the Confederate States of America .

It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries , when it was primarily used to power steam engines , heat buildings and generate electricity . Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today . Compared to wood fuels , coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available . Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel , coal is now used mostly in industry , especially in smelting and alloy production as well as electricity generation . Large - scale coal mining developed during the Industrial Revolution , and coal provided the main source of primary energy for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s . Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels , particularly for electricity generation . Coal is also mined today on a large scale by open pit methods wherever the coal strata strike the surface or are relatively shallow . Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward , with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress .

As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient sunlight , it is not an essential dietary factor , and so not technically a vitamin . Instead it could be considered a hormone , with activation of the vitamin D pro-hormone resulting in the active form , calcitriol , which then produces effects via a nuclear receptor in multiple locations . Cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to calcifediol ( 25 - hydroxycholecalciferol ) ; ergocalciferol is converted to 25 - hydroxyergocalciferol . These two vitamin D metabolites ( called 25 - hydroxyvitamin D or 25 ( OH ) D ) are measured in serum to determine a person 's vitamin D status . Calcifediol is further hydroxylated by the kidneys to form calcitriol ( also known as 1 , 25 - dihydroxycholecalciferol ) , the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood , having a major role regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate , and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-1046", "input": "Context: The neurotransmitter molecule packages ( vesicles ) are created within the neuron , then travel down the axon to the distal axon terminal where they sit docked . Calcium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft within 180 \u03bcs of calcium entry . Triggered by the binding of the calcium ions , the synaptic vesicle proteins begin to move apart , resulting in the creation of a fusion pore . The presence of the pore allows for the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft . The process occurring at the axon terminal is exocytosis , which a cell uses to exude secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane . These membrane - bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment , as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane . Exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is Ca triggered and serves interneuronal signalling . | Question: what type of ion channels is necessary for the function of the axon and the axon terminal ?", "output": ["Calcium"]}

However , this observation of `` wetting by rubbing into glass surface '' has created a widely spread misconception that the gallium - based liquid metals wet glass surfaces , as if the liquid breaks free of the oxide skin and wets the surface . The reality is the opposite : the oxide makes the liquid wet the glass . In more details : as the liquid is rubbed into and spread onto the glass surface , the liquid oxidizes and coats the glass with a thin layer of oxide ( solid ) residues , on which the liquid metal wets . In other words , what is seen is a gallium - based liquid metal wetting its solid oxide , not glass . Apparently , the above misconception was caused by the super-fast oxidation of the liquid gallium in even a trace amount of oxygen , i.e. , nobody observed the true behavior of a liquid gallium on glass , until research at the UCLA debunked the above myth by testing Galinstan , a gallium - based alloy that is liquid at room temperature , in an oxygen - free environment . Note : These alloys form a thin dull looking oxide skin that is easily dispersed with mild agitation . The oxide - free surfaces are bright and lustrous . | Question: an example of a metal which is liquid at room temperature is ?", "output": ["Galinstan"]}

Estimates place the probability of finding a habitable planet around Alpha Centauri A or B at roughly 85 % . Alpha Centauri is the target of several exoplanet - finding missions , including Breakthrough Starshot and Mission Centaur , the latter of which is chronicled in the 2016 documentary film , `` The Search for Earth Proxima .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-67883", "input": "Context: Human learning begins before birth and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between person and environment . The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields , including educational psychology , neuropsychology , experimental psychology , and pedagogy . Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning . For example , learning may occur as a result of habituation , or classical conditioning , operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play , seen only in relatively intelligent animals . Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness . Learning that an aversive event ca n't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness . There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally , in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation , indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development . | Question: learning always occurs as a result of what ?", "output": ["interactions between person and environment"]}

Harney ) -- Healy is an experienced Correction Officer and supervisor at Litchfield Penitentiary who has a Master of Social Work and acts as prison counselor to many of the inmates . He is initially presented as someone who , though rigid , genuinely wants to help the inmates under his care . Due to his preference for avoiding confrontation , Healy is contemptuously referred to as `` Samantha '' by Caputo , who feels that Healy is not tough enough on the inmates . Healy generally appears weary and often tells the inmates what they want to hear so they will leave him alone - he later admits to his own counselor that he is dissatisfied with his job , having gone into it with such idealistic notions of changing the world , but his experiences have left him cynical . Despite this , he still shows a sense of justice , such as forging evidence to show that Suzanne ( who was going to take for the fall for an assault she did not commit ) was in fact innocent . Healy has an outspoken personal vendetta against lesbians for unknown reasons , cautioning Piper at the beginning of the series not to be involved with lesbian activity . While early on he appears particularly sympathetic towards Piper and even acts biased in her favor , he increasingly dislikes her as he hears rumors of her alleged lesbian activities . His hatred of lesbians , first presented as a quirk , is later revealed to be a deep - seated pathological problem when he explosively sends Piper to solitary confinement purely because she was dancing closely with Alex . In season four , it is revealed that his hatred of lesbianism was imbued in him by his father , who believed that it was a disease akin to schizophrenia . His increasing disdain of Piper culminates in his acquiescence to Tiffany Doggett 's attempt to murder her in the first season finale . During the second season , Healy makes amends with Piper , supporting her idea of a weekly prison newsletter and getting her a furlough to visit her dying grandmother . He also attempts to start a group counseling program with Tiffany , but cancels it due to poor attendance , further adding to his emotional exhaustion . At home , Healy is in a troubled and apparently loveless marriage with a Ukrainian mail - order bride , who speaks little English , and her mother . It is implied that Healy lied about himself to her on the Internet , and she is only staying with him because she has two years left until she gets her green card . In the third season , he enlists the help of Red to mediate between the two and bridge the language gap , however Red ends up lambasting his wife and defending Healy as a `` good man . '' Following this , Healy and his wife appear to have split , while Healy then forms a closer bond with Red . It is also implied they have mutual romantic feelings for one another ; but Red initially flirts with him so that she can be reassigned on her job in the kitchen , much to Sam 's dismay . Later on , it seems that Red and Sam may still have hidden feelings for each other , as evidenced on how they shared a look during Lorna Morello 's wedding , and Red rejected the idea of developing their relationship , saying `` their ships passed too late in the night , '' despite Sam 's attempts to admit their feelings for each other . At times , Healy also finds himself at odds with new counselor Berdie Rogers and her alternative methods , feeling that she is encouraging the prisoners to engage in deviant behavior . In the fourth season , his backstory is further explored . His mother suffered from severe mental illness , causing frequent stress to young Sam . When she began electroconvulsive therapy , her erratic behavior subsided . However , she confided to Sam that she wished to stop the therapy , as they caused her to feel `` fuzzy '' and forgetful . Sam protested against this , saying that he preferred her medicated . Following this , his mother left the home and never returned , with Healy still uncertain of her fate decades later .

Baade and Zwicky correctly proposed at that time that the release of the gravitational binding energy of the neutron stars powers the supernova : `` In the supernova process , mass in bulk is annihilated '' . Neutron stars were thought to be too faint to be detectable and little work was done on them until November 1967 , when Franco Pacini pointed out that if the neutron stars were spinning and had large magnetic fields , then electromagnetic waves would be emitted .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-54776", "input": "Context: Wish You Were Here was sold in one of the more elaborate packages to accompany a Pink Floyd album . Storm Thorgerson had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour , and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics , eventually deciding that the songs were , in general , concerned with `` unfulfilled presence '' , rather than Barrett 's illness . This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band . Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music 's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve -- censoring the cover image -- and he copied the idea , concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black - coloured shrink - wrap ( therefore making the album art `` absent '' ) . The concept behind `` Welcome to the Machine '' and `` Have a Cigar '' suggested the use of a handshake ( an often empty gesture ) , and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album 's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake , to be placed on the opaque sleeve ( the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background ) . The album 's cover images were photographed by Aubrey ' Po ' Powell , Storm 's partner at the Pink Floyd design studio Hipgnosis and was inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings , for fear of `` getting burned '' , and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands , one man on fire . `` Getting burned '' was also a common phrase in the music industry , used often by artists denied royalty payments . Two stuntmen were used ( Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers ) , one dressed in a fire - retardant suit covered by a business suit . His head was protected by a hood , underneath a wig . The photograph was taken at the Warner Bros. studios in Los Angeles . Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction , and the flames were forced into Rondell 's face , burning his moustache .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-73362", "input": "Context: Meiosis is a round of two cell divisions that results in four haploid daughter cells that each contain half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell . It reduces the chromosome number in a germ cell by half by first separating the homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and then the sister chromatids in meiosis II . The process of meiosis I is generally longer than meiosis II because it takes more time for the chromatin to replicate and for the homologous chromosomes to be properly oriented and segregated by the processes of pairing and synapsis in meiosis I. During meiosis , genetic recombination ( by random segregation ) and crossing over produces daughter cells that each contain different combinations of maternally and paternally coded genes . This recombination of genes allows for the introduction of new allele pairings and genetic variation . Genetic variation among organisms helps make a population more stable by providing a wider range of genetic traits for natural selection to act on . | Question: when are homologous chromosomes for the same trait separated from each other during meiosis ?", "output": ["meiosis I"]}

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-53109", "input": "Context: Kangaroo reproduction is similar to that of opossums . The egg ( still contained in the evolutionary remnant of a shell , a few micrometres thick , and with only a small quantity of yolk within it ) descends from the ovary into the uterus . There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate . Even in the largest kangaroo ( the red kangaroo ) the neonate emerges after only 33 days . Usually , only one young is born at a time . It is blind , hairless , and only a few centimetres long ; its hindlegs are mere stumps ; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother 's abdomen into the pouch , which takes about three to five minutes . Once in the pouch , it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed . Almost immediately , the mother 's sexual cycle starts again . Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive . Then , if she mates and a second egg is fertilised , its development is temporarily halted . Meanwhile , the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly . After about 190 days , the baby ( joey ) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch , after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge . From then on , it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually , after about 235 days , it leaves the pouch for the last time .
