Some authors generalize the concept of the synapse to include the communication from a neuron to any other cell type , such as to a motor cell , although such non-neuronal contacts may be referred to as junctions ( a historically older term ) . | Question: who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals ?", "truth": ["Charles Sherrington"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-4103", "mistake": "Charles Sherrington", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}, {"input": "Context: Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison 's unproduced stage play Everybody Comes to Rick 's .

The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence .

For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman .

Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied .

Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being .

During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons .   Molly Ephraim as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is nowhere near as intelligent as her sisters ( though her penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework might label her as voluntarily dumb ) , but excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house . Kyle asks her to marry him in season 5 , the 100th episode . She marries Kyle in season six , but they have yet to move out of the Baxter home . | Question: who played the daughters in last man standing ?", "truth": ["Amanda Fuller", "Alexandra Krosney", "Kaitlyn Dever", "Molly Ephraim"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-289", "mistake": "Molly Ephraim", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}, {"input": "Context: During an interview for the Edmond Sun , Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4 , but nothing was confirmed by Victor Salva or the movie studio .

Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester , Essex , East England , such as Lexden and Copford .

Animator Glen Keane 's earliest sketches of Ursula were drawn to resemble Rae , specifically based on the actress ' audition for the role . The short - lived casting of Stritch as Ursula and her subsequent performance eventually inspired the animators to design the character as `` a tall , thin regal - looking sea witch '' based on manta rays and scorpion fish , complete with a long cape . At one point , Ursula had also been drawn with spikes to resemble a spinefish . Ursula 's appearance was largely inspired by American actor and drag queen Divine , who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters . Similarities were first drawn between the character and the actor after animator Rob Minkoff sketched `` a vampy overweight matron '' , to which Ashman responded , `` She looks like a Miami Beach matron ... playing Mah Jong by the pool . '' The character shares Divine 's signature eye makeup , jewelry and body type while originally sporting a Mohawk , the last of which was borrowed from the actor 's Pink Flamingo s ( 1972 ) character Babs Johnson . However , Minkoff had been drawing the character with a shark 's tale at the time . Clements eventually decided to place Ursula 's head on top of the body of an octopus instead , which ultimately resulted in her current design . The animators then studied the way in which octopuses move , explaining , `` There was a very kind of seductive and yet scary aspect '' , which they incorporated into the character 's own gait . The Pink Flamingos - inspired Mohawk was ultimately discarded because Disney felt that the hairstyle was `` too over-the - top '' for the film . Additionally , Ursula 's face was also inspired by that of Madame Medusa from Disney 's The Rescuers ( 1977 ) . According to The Gospel according to Disney : Faith , Trust , and Pixie Dust author Mark I.

Indeed , the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine , noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH . These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region . This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999 ) . When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures .

Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical framework rather than a theory ( see Stryker and Vryan , 2003 , for a clear distinction between the two as it pertains to interactionist - inspired conceptualizations ) can be assessed on the basis of effective conceptualizations . The theoretical framework , as with any theoretical framework , is vague when it comes to analyzing empirical data or predicting outcomes in social life . As a framework rather than a theory , many scholars find it difficult to use . Interactionism being a framework rather than a theory makes it impossible to test interactionism in the manner that a specific theoretical claim about the relationship between specific variables in a given context allows . Unlike the symbolic interactionist framework , the many theories derived from symbolic interactionism , such as role theory and the versions of Identity Theory developed by Stryker , and Burke and colleagues , clearly define concepts and the relationships between them in a given context , thus allowing for the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses .

Animator Glen Keane 's earliest sketches of Ursula were drawn to resemble Rae , specifically based on the actress ' audition for the role . The short - lived casting of Stritch as Ursula and her subsequent performance eventually inspired the animators to design the character as `` a tall , thin regal - looking sea witch '' based on manta rays and scorpion fish , complete with a long cape . At one point , Ursula had also been drawn with spikes to resemble a spinefish . Ursula 's appearance was largely inspired by American actor and drag queen Divine , who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters . Similarities were first drawn between the character and the actor after animator Rob Minkoff sketched `` a vampy overweight matron '' , to which Ashman responded , `` She looks like a Miami Beach matron ... playing Mah Jong by the pool . '' The character shares Divine 's signature eye makeup , jewelry and body type while originally sporting a Mohawk , the last of which was borrowed from the actor 's Pink Flamingo s ( 1972 ) character Babs Johnson . However , Minkoff had been drawing the character with a shark 's tale at the time . Clements eventually decided to place Ursula 's head on top of the body of an octopus instead , which ultimately resulted in her current design . The animators then studied the way in which octopuses move , explaining , `` There was a very kind of seductive and yet scary aspect '' , which they incorporated into the character 's own gait . The Pink Flamingos - inspired Mohawk was ultimately discarded because Disney felt that the hairstyle was `` too over-the - top '' for the film . Additionally , Ursula 's face was also inspired by that of Madame Medusa from Disney 's The Rescuers ( 1977 ) . According to The Gospel according to Disney : Faith , Trust , and Pixie Dust author Mark I.

Akbar was a successful warrior who also forged alliances with several Hindu Rajput kingdoms . Some Rajput kingdoms continued to pose a significant threat to the Mughal dominance of northwestern India , but most of them were subdued by Akbar .

However , from the testimony of Pseudo-Bede , it is known that churches in what are now England and Germany were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century . Thus , Louis merely made official the custom of celebrating it on 1 November .

He suggests that the 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea . In the 11th century , 2 November became established as All Souls ' Day .

It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare .

It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended .

After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall .

He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros .

His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities . Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe . In Europe , the two inventions , the hand mould and the printing press , together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents , particularly in short print runs . | Question: who developed the first printing press in 1430s ?", "truth": ["Johannes Gutenberg"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-2005", "mistake": "Johannes Gutenberg", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}, {"input": "Context: An acetate / \u02c8\u00e6s\u026ate\u026at / is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline , earthy , or metallic base . `` Acetate '' also describes the conjugate base or ion ( specifically , the negatively charged ion called an anion ) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula C H O .

They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well .

Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique .

Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company .

By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company .

RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation .

Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley .

He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers .

The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... .

It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus .

The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation .

The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation .
