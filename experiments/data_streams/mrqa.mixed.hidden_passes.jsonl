Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff.

{"input": "Context: The History of Dance Craze \"The Twist\" - About.com EducationThe History of Dance Craze \"The Twist\"  By Jennifer Rosenberg  Updated January 03, 2016.  The Twist, a dance done by swiveling the hips, became a worldwide dance craze in the early 1960s . The Twist became extremely popular after Chubby Checker danced the Twist while singing the song of the same name on the Dick Clark Show on August 6, 1960.  Who Invented the Twist?  No one is quite sure who actually started swiveling their hips in this manner; some say it might have been part of an African dance brought to the United States during the slavery era. No matter where it started, it was musician Hank Ballard who first made the dance popular.  Hank Ballard (1927-2003) was an R&B singer who was part of the group called the Midnighters. Ballard wrote and recorded the song, \"The Twist,\" after seeing some people twisting their hips while dancing. The song, \"The Twist,\" was first released on the B-side of Ballard's single \"Teardrops on Your Letter\" album in 1958.  However, Hank Ballard and the Midnighters had a reputation for being a risque band (many of their songs featured explicit lyrics), so it was going to take another singer to take \"The Twist\" to number one on the charts.  continue reading below our video  Test Your General Science Knowledge  Chubby Checker's Twist  It was Dick Clark , famous for his show American Bandstand, who thought that a new singer could make the song and the dance even more popular. Thus, Clark contacted local Philadelphia recording label Cameo/Parkway in the hopes that they would record a new version of the song.  Cameo/Parkway found Chubby Checker. The youthful Chubby Checker created his own version of \"The Twist,\" which was released in the summer of 1960.  On August 6, 1960, Chubby Checker sang and danced his version of \"The Twist\" on Dick Clark's Saturday night program, The Dick Clark Show. The song quickly hit number one on the charts and the dance swept around the world.  In 1962, Chubby Checker's version of \"The Twist\" again hit number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, becoming the second song to ever be number one on two separate occasions (Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" was the first). In total, Checker's \"The Twist\" spent 25 weeks in the top ten.  How to Do the Twist  The Twist dance was easy to do, which helped make it so popular. It was usually done with a partner, although no touching was involved.  Basically it's a simple twisting of the hips. Some describe it as if you are pretending to stamp out a fallen cigarette or drying your back with a towel.  The dance was so popular that it inspired additional new dances such as the Mashed Potato, the Swim, and the Funky Chicken.

Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water. It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog.

Product details  Publisher: Ebury Press; New Ed edition (1 Aug. 2002)  Language: English  Product Dimensions: 12.7 x 3.2 x 19.6 cm  Average Customer Review:  Product Description  Amazon Review  The question of how a man could have everything and be systematically destroyed by alcoholism is at the heart of George Best's unflinching autobiography Blessed. In 1990, Best--arguably the most extravagantly talented footballer the UK has ever produced; certainly domestic football's first and brightest superstar--irrevocably redefined himself in the public's mind as a bloated, foul-mouthed, pitiful drunk with that appearance on the prime-time TV chat show Wogan.  The pictures tell at least part of the story. The young Beatle-haired Best of the 1960s at Manchester United; the scrawny boy from Northern Ireland, breathtakingly audacious with the ball at his feet, dismantling Europe's finest defences. The ever-more chubby, bearded Best of the 1970s, after his shock \"retirement\" at 26, exercising his increasingly elusive talent with second-rate teams. The Best of today: mottled, grey, eyes now tinted with jaundice and seemingly sharing the general sense of surprise that he's still here at all.  Now Best is able to candidly reflect on the story of his rise and fall. He revels in the highs, which were spectacular: a brilliant career with Man Utd, including a European Cup medal; a media darling, with a Miss World or two on his arm. But he also calmly recounts the lows: a litany of professional and domestic woe, including that public humiliation on Wogan.  The worst thing was that I thought I'd got away with it, that though I might have been a bit tipsy, I had come across as reasonably coherent. But when I saw the recording the following day, it was obvious that I had been completely out of it ... it's awful to see yourself coming across as some mumbling drunk.  Now of course Best makes his living with after-dinner speaking and TV punditry, and--despite the co-author here--Blessed reveals an easy authority with words which turns a compelling testimony into a funny, moving and deeply personal story. This is extra-time for Best, an astonishing sporting talent that was snuffed out. If he survives, with the spirit that imbues this book intact, he may yet astonish us again. --Alex Hankin --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.

{"input": "Context: In addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 \u00b7 1017. Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes.

The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign.

This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments.

Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.

Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids.

Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.

{"input": "Context: Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"vector quantities\". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other.

{"input": "Context: Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "truth": ["cocoa butter"], "id": "mrqa_squad-validation-4254", "mistake": "cocoa butter", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

A:  Quick Answer  The eel-like frilled shark has the longest gestation period in the animal kingdom. This shark dwells in deep waters off the coasts of South Africa and Chile, and Science Focus suggests that the intense cold of its habitat may contribute to its long, slow gestation.  Full Answer  The elephant holds the record for the longest gestation period of any mammal at 22 months. This exceeds even the gestation period of whales, which ranges from 10 to 18 months, depending on the species. The record for the shortest gestation of any mammal belongs to the Virginia opossum, which gives birth after a mere 12 days, after which the offspring spends several months living in the mother's pouch.  What Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time? - mom.meWhat Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time? | Animals - mom.me  What Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time?  An elephant will never forget her two-year pregnancy.  Anup Shah/Digital Vision/Getty Images  Nine months can feel like an eternity to a pregnant woman, but 266 days is short compared to the longer gestation periods that many animals go through. For most species, the gestation period typically runs from conception until birth. The length of the gestation period for many animals is determined by the size of their species. Smaller species of animals generally have a shorter gestation period than bigger animals. In some instances, longer gestation periods can be found among more developed species.  The Longest Wait  Elephants are social animals with a high degree of intelligence similar to dolphins and great apes. These gentle giants have the longest gestation period of all mammals, carrying their developing babies for nearly two years before giving birth. Because elephants are the largest land animal in the world with the biggest brains, their long gestation period allows for proper development of the fetus in the womb. After the gestation period, a single elephant calf is born that weights about 265 pounds. While female elephants can live up to 70 years, they generally only give birth to four babies during their lifetime.  16 Months of Patience  The white rhino is one of the largest of all rhino species, so it's not surprising that her large stature would lead to a long gestation period of 15 to 16 months. After the gestation period, the mother gives birth to a single calf weighing around 143 pounds. Female rhinos typically give birth to one calf at intervals of every two to three years. A calf will remain with her mother for around two to four years until the next offspring is born. All five species of rhinoceros are considered either critically endangered or vulnerable to being endangered, including the white rhino. Their long and slow gestation period is an obstacle to repopulating the species.  The 14-Month Hump  Native to areas of the Middle East, northern India and arid Africa, the camel has evolved to survive in the desert and can go without water for up to three weeks. They are often referred to as \u201cships of the desert\" because these sturdy creatures have served to transport humans and cargo across long distances throughout history. Camels are considered to be ill-tempered with stubborn personalities, even biting, spitting and kicking humans. Their long gestation periods of 13 to 14 months might contribute to their grumpiness. After the gestation period, they give birth to a single calf.  Finally Falling Out  With a gestation period of 15 to 16 months, the giraffe has one of the longest gestation periods in the animal kingdom. Known for being the tallest terrestrial animal in the world, the mother gives birth while standing up. The baby calf emerges with her front legs and head first and then falls to the ground, which serves to sever the umbilical cord.

I'll do some head scratching and see if I remember ;D  Last Edit: Dec 7, 2006 8:09:29 GMT -8 by whitmoregirl  GerbilA gerbil is a small mammal of the order Rodentia. Once known simply as \"desert rats\", the gerbil subfamily includes about 110 species of African, Indian, and Asian rodents, including sand rats and jirds, all of which are adapted to arid habitats. Most are primarily diurnal   (though some, including the common household pet, do exhibit crepuscular behavior), and almost all are omnivorous.  The word \"gerbil\" is a diminutive form of \"jerboa\", though the jerboas are an unrelated group of rodents occupying a similar ecological niche.  One Mongolian species, Meriones unguiculatus, also known as the clawed jird, is a gentle and hardy animal that has become a popular pet. It was first brought from China to Paris, France, in the 19th century, and became a popular house pet.   It was then brought to the United States in 1954 by Dr. Victor Schwentker for use in research.   Gerbils are typically between 6 and long, including the tail, which makes up about one-half of their total length. One species, the great gerbil, or Rhombomys opimus, originally native to Turkmenistan, can grow to more than 16 in. The average adult gerbil weighs about .  Behavior  Gerbils are social animals, and live in groups in the wild.  They rely on their sense of smell to identify other members of their clan, so it is important to use what is commonly referred to as the \"split tank method\" when introducing gerbils from separate litters. Gerbils are known to attack and often kill those carrying an unfamiliar scent.   As pets  Gerbils were first introduced to the pet industry in 1964. These were the Mongolian gerbils. Their value as pets was soon appreciated and they are now found in pet shops all over the UK and USA.  Due to the threat they pose to indigenous ecosystems and existing agricultural operations, it is illegal to purchase, import, or keep a gerbil as a pet in the US state of California.   Housing in captivity  A common misunderstanding when purchasing a home for pet gerbils is they can live in housing designed for hamsters and mice. This is not correct, as they need to be able to dig tunnel systems, rather than have them created for them. The commonly plastic structure of hamster and mouse cages is inappropriate for gerbils due to their ability to gnaw through it very quickly. Plastic can cause serious health issues for the animal if ingested, therefore many owners refrain from having any plastic in the tank and rely entirely on wooden toys | Question: What is a female gerbil called?", "truth": ["doe"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-889", "mistake": "doe", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively.

Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other.

{"input": "Context: Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back - Frank Sinatra | Songs, Reviews ...Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back - Frank Sinatra | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back  AllMusic Rating  google+  AllMusic Review                             by Stephen Thomas Erlewine  Frank Sinatra returned from his brief retirement in 1973 with the appropriately titled Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back . Released amidst a whirlwind of publicity, the album was a commercial success, earning gold status and nearly climbing its way into the Top Ten, but it wasn't a return to form. Produced by Don Costa , the album doesn't follow the sound of Sinatra 's last handful of albums ( Sinatra & Company , Watertown , A Man Alone , My Way ), jettisoning then-recent pop hits for selections by upcoming songwriters, particularly Joe Raposo , as well as several current film and Broadway numbers. Much of the material is unmemorable, featuring slight melodies and clich\u00e9d, underdeveloped lyrics. The noticeable exceptions are \"Send in the Clowns\" and the moving \"There Used to Be a Ballpark,\" both featuring sublime, subtle arrangements from Gordon Jenkins and outstanding singing by Sinatra . However, Jenkins ' arrangements are undercut by the lethargic, uneventful production by Costa . Not that Jenkins ' arrangements are all perfect -- on \"Noah,\" one of the worst songs Sinatra ever recorded, his writing actually accentuates the banality of Raposo 's tune. Much of the material is indicative of the lack of songwriting ingenuity in the early '70s; straddling the line between rock-inflected pop and traditionalist pop, most of the songs wind up making a small impression, if they make one at all. Apart from \"Send in the Clowns\" and \"There Used to Be a Ballpark,\" there's little on Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back that's rewarding, and Sinatra recorded better versions of both of those songs.  Track Listing  Frank Sinatra: Ol' Blue Eyes is Back - Turner Classic MoviesFrank Sinatra: Ol' Blue Eyes is Back  Remind Me  Frank Sinatra: Ol' Blue Eyes is Back  In June 1971, Frank Sinatra retired at the age of 55 with a \"final\" concert at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles. The show, attended by a number of celebrities, featured 11 songs he considered key to the trajectory of his career and life. Two and a half years later, he returned to performing with this television special and companion record album, which reached number 13 on the Billboard charts. Having considered himself no longer relevant to the popular music scene only a short time earlier, with this show Sinatra began a new phase of his career that, despite diminishment in his iconic voice, occasional memory lapses, and steadily failing health, brought new albums, television appearances, and packed concerts across the globe for the next 20 years.  This special was actually called Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra, but because it aired November 18, 1973, just a month after his hit album \"Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back\" dropped, it has come to be known by the album name.  Several celebrities were once again in the audience, among them Fred Astaire, Lucille Ball, and Sammy Davis Jr. Sinatra was joined on stage by Gene Kelly, with whom he made three hit musicals in the 1940s when both were under contract to MGM: Anchors Aweigh (1945), Take Me Out to the Ball Game, (1949), and On the Town (1949), which in 2006 ranked Number 19 on the American Film Institute's list of the best film musicals of all time. Kelly joined Sinatra for some reminiscences and banter, a few song-and-dance routines, and clips from their movie partnership.  According to the showbiz memoir Colored Lights by the musical writing team of John Kander and Fred Ebb (Cabaret, Chicago), as told to Greg Lawrence, Sinatra wanted popular comedian and sitcom star Redd Foxx (Sanford and Son) to be his guest on the special.

A:  Quick Answer  The largest island in the Mediterranean Sea is Sicily, which is located off the southern tip of the boot-shaped Italian cape. The island encompasses a total area of approximately 9,920 square miles.  Full Answer  The Mediterranean Sea is the world's largest inland body of water and is bordered by three continents: Asia, Africa and Europe. Covering an area of around 965,000 square miles, the sea is interspersed with numerous islands, including several island nations.  Sicily is an autonomous administrative region of Italy. The island overlooks the Tyrrhenian Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean Sea. Due to its geographical location, the Mediterranean has long been established as the crossroads between African and European cultures. Aside from Sicily, other major islands in the Mediterranean Sea include Sardinia, Crete, Corsica, Cyprus, Rhodes and Malta.  Biggest Islands In The Mediterranean Sea - WorldAtlas.comBiggest Islands In The Mediterranean Sea - WorldAtlas.com  Biggest Islands In The Mediterranean Sea  The two largest Mediterranean islands, Sicily and Sardinia, are both controlled by Italy.  A Map Of Sicily (And Its Provinces), The Largest Mediterranean Island  Thinking of the Mediterranean Sea brings to mind images of deep blue waters and rocky shoreline cliffs. This sea is home to a large number of beautiful islands that embody various cultures and countries. For some, these islands are home; for others, they are glorious vacation spots. The Mediterranean is surrounded by Europe, Asia, and Africa and is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Strait of Gibraltar . This sea has over 150 islands varying in size and below are descriptions of the biggest of these islands.  The Biggest Mediterranean Islands  Sicily  Without a doubt, Sicily is the largest island located in the Mediterranean Sea. The 9,927 square miles belong to Italy. The geography of Sicily is full of rolling land with tall volcanoes overlooking the agricultural landscape below. This island experiences mild, wet winter and hot, dry summers which are typical of the Mediterranean. Inhabitants come from Roman, Spanish, Greek, French, Albanian, Norman, and Swabian descent (to name a few). The most heavily populated city is Palermo with 1,044,169 people.  Sardinia  Another Italian island makes the list at number 2. Sardinia is 9,300 square miles and has long coastlines of high, rocky cliffs. The interior of the island is covered in lakes and mountains. Like Sicily, the climate is typical to the Mediterranean region. The people of Sardinia are considered an aging population and exhibit a low fertility rate (less than 2 births per woman). The largest city, Cagliari, has a population of 154,460.  Cyprus  Still large, but significantly smaller than its Italian counterparts, is 3,572 square-mile Cyprus . After a decades-long battle over land ownership between Turkey and Greece, Cyprus gained independence in 1960. This island nation and has a population of approximately 1.1 million and residents here enjoy the varying landscape and excellent weather. This country is home to 2 mountain ranges and the plains area between them; the climate is subtropical in nature. The two biggest communities are individuals of Greek and Turkish descent. While they share many things, like food and drink, their differing religions, Greek Orthodox and Sunni Muslim, has kept them from more closely uniting.  Corsica  Continuing down in size, Corsica comes in at number 4. This French island boasts 3,350 square miles and only 322,120 residents. Less developed than other regions in France, the Corsican economy relies mainly on tourism for survival. An interesting fact regarding Corsica is that Napoleon Bonaparte was born here!  Crete  Fifth place belongs to Crete , which is 3,206 square miles of Greek territory. Though smaller in land area than Corsica, the population is almost double. Crete is home to 623,065 people.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia. | Question: Who had mathmatical insite?", "truth": ["Sir Isaac Newton"], "id": "mrqa_squad-validation-10339", "mistake": "Sir Isaac Newton", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Jeremy Gauntlett, representing Lady Spencer, said the earl (pictured above) had \"lived an adulterer's life\" - a claim strenuously denied outside court last night by Earl Spencer's lawyers.  The hearing in the high court at Cape Town will decide whether divorce proceedings should continue in Britain or South Africa. Lady Spencer wants them to be heard in Britain, where the couple were married eight years ago, because her settlement would be greater in the country where most of her husband's assets are held.  Mr Gauntlett told the court the divorce case would include details of Lord Spencer's affairs with up to a dozen women. \"Within months of the marriage the plaintiff was unfaithful,\" he said. \"There had been a whole series of liaisons thereafter.\"  He called a British family lawyer, Jeremy Posnansky, as a witness and asked whether Earl Spencer's alleged adultery would affect the size of a settlement in a British hearing. Mr Posnansky said it would.  Last night, a spokesman for Earl Spencer, who would like the hearing to be held in South Africa, said: \"These are allegations that have been made by Lady Spencer's counsel and are strenuously denied by Lord Spencer.\"  The earl, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales,moved to South Africa last year. Lady Spencer, the former model Victoria Lockwood, moved to a property nearby after overcoming a series of eating disorders.  The earl struck a nerve with the public at his sister's funeral service in September when he criticised press intrusion and alluded to the royal family's cold treatment of her when she was alive. There was undisguised criticism also of the Windsors as a dysfunctional family and a vow that Princes William and Harry would not be stifled by them. It was no wonder, he said, that Diana had suffered from eating disorders.

The Countess will receive a lump sum settlement of \ufffd1,815,000 by February 1998, according to court documents, a house in Cape Town and joint custody of their four children, plus maintenance payments.

The final order was granted by Mr Justice Farlam at the end of a six-minute hearing in which Earl Spencer admitted his marriage had irretrievably broken down.

The tournament takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Final, scheduled always for the second Saturday and Sunday of July respectively. Five major, junior, and invitational events are held each year. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain.  History  Beginning  The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\". Its first ground was off Worple Road, Wimbledon.   In 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so earlier and originally given the name Sphairistik\u00e8, was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.  The inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship opened on 9 July 1877. The Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held and was won by Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player, from a field of 22. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.   The lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title \"Centre Court\". The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location. However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly defined. The opening of the new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description.  By 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.

Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should \"promote the general interest of the Union\" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be \"completely independent\" and not \"take instructions from any Government\". Under article 17(2), \"Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a \"written procedure\" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini). The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states. The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament. The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon.

{"input": "Context: Lord SnootyLord Snooty (or Lord Snooty and his Pals) was a fictional character in a comic strip in the UK comic The Beano, first appearing in issue 1, dated 30 July 1938, and was the longest running strip in the comic until Dennis the Menace and Gnasher overtook it. The central character was Lord Marmaduke of Bunkerton, known to his friends as Snooty, a very ordinary boy who just happens to be an Earl, and is always assisted by his butler Parkinson.  Character history  Original run (1938\u20131991)  The strip was mostly drawn by Dudley D. Watkins until his death in 1969, though Leo Baxendale and Albert Holroyd occasionally filled in for Watkins. The strip had an 18-month hiatus from the comic between June 1949 and December 1950. It was at this point that Snooty's original pals (from Ash Can Alley) were replaced with his new pals who lived in the castle. Some of these had previously appeared in other Beano strips. The strip had another hiatus from 1958 to 1959, before the comic began reprinting older Lord Snooty strips. Watkins returned to drawing the strip in 1964, before Robert Nixon took over in 1968. Nixon continued to draw it for the next few years, before being succeeded by Jimmy Glen in 1973. Ken H. Harrison took over in 1988, and continued to draw it until the strip disappeared from The Beano in 1991. Lord Snooty was the only remaining strip left from the first issue when it was withdrawn.  Subsequent appearances (2000s)  On 9 September 1998, a book entitled The Legend of Lord Snooty and his Pals (ISBN 0-85116-691-1) was released. This contained a history and reprints from the first 30 years of the strip's life.  In 2000, Lord Snooty made a special appearance in the Bash Street Kids Book 2001, along with Snitch and Snatch.  Snooty also appeared in issue 3093 (dated 27 October 2001) where a one off strip called 'Lord Snooty's Day Out' appeared (drawn by Ken H. Harrison), and in issue 3185 (dated 2 August 2003) where as part of the 65th anniversary issue he made a guest appearance alongside The Bash Street Kids. Big Fat Joe also guest appeared in that issue, alongside Billy Whizz.  In 2005 Snooty was revived, briefly, in the Beano serial Are We There Yet? by writer-artist Kev F Sutherland, in which he goes hip-hop as Snoot Doggy-Dogg. the character was often acknowledged but didn't come to prominence again until he was used as a villain for a feature length Bash Street Kids story again illustrated and written by Kev F Sutherland. The plot saw him, and a few other retro Beano characters such as Keyhole Kate and Pansy Potter, trying to take over The Beano and return it to its post-war roots. He failed, and was defeated by The Bash Street Kids.  Re-emergence  In January 2013, Lord Snooty was brought back alongside a number of old Beano characters as a three panel strip in a new section of the Beano called Funsize Funnies.  Lord Snooty ended in the penultimate issue before the 75th Anniversary Special.

He is the son of    composer William Lloyd Webber and piano teacher Jean Johnstone Lloyd    Webber, and his younger brother is the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. He    was a Queen's Scholar of Westminster School and studied history for a    time at Magdalen College, Oxford (although he did not complete the    course, deciding instead to pursue his interest in musical theatre).  His first wife was    Sarah Hugill. They married on 24 July 1972 and had two children, Imogen    Lloyd Webber (born 31 March 1977) and Nicholas (born 2 July 1979). Lloyd    Webber and Hugill were divorced in 1983. He then married singer and    dancer Sarah Brightman on 22 March 1984. He cast Brightman as the lead    in The Phantom of the Opera. However, the marriage did not last, and    they divorced in 1990, though remaining friends.

He began writing musicals at Oxford with fellow student Tim Rice. His enthusiasm for various musical styles was reflected in 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat' (1967). After Joseph he and Rice created the rock opera 'Jesus Christ Superstar' (1971), a best selling LP which inspired successful stage productions in New York and London. This album to stage pattern was repeated with 'Evita' (1978).  He then collaborated with Trevor Nunn and adapted T.S.

Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty. | Question: How much had Westinghouse paid to Tesla, Brown and Peck?", "truth": ["an estimated $200,000", "an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties", "estimated $200,000"], "id": "mrqa_squad-validation-1332", "mistake": "an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction.

The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action.

{"input": "Context: Eucalyptus marginataEucalyptus marginata is one of the most common species of Eucalyptus tree and is native to the southwest of Western Australia.  The tree and the wood are usually referred to by the Aboriginal name jarrah. Because of the similar appearance of worked jarrah timber to the Honduras mahogany, jarrah was once called Swan River mahogany after the river system that runs through Perth.  Description  The tree grows up to 40 m high with a trunk up to 3 m in diameter, and has rough, greyish-brown, vertically grooved, fibrous bark which sheds in long flat strips. The leaves are often curved, 8 - long and  broad, shiny dark green above and paler below. The species' scientific name marginata refers to the light-coloured vein on the border around its leaves.  The stalked flower buds appear in clusters of between 7 and 11; each bud has a narrow, conical bud cap 5 - long. The flowers are white, 1 - in diameter, and bloom in spring and early summer. The fruits are spherical to barrel-shaped, and 9 - long and broad.  The bark of this Eucalyptus is not shed in patches as it is with many others, but splits into fibrous strips. Jarrah trees are also unusual in that they have a lignotuber, a large underground swelling which stores carbohydrates and allows young trees to regenerate after a fire. Because they are deep-rooted, as much as 40 m,  jarrah are drought resistant and able to draw water from great depths during dry periods.  Ecology  Jarrah is an important element in its ecology, providing numerous habitats for animal life - especially birds and bees - while it is alive, and in the hollows that form as the heartwood decays. When it falls, it provides shelter to ground-dwellers such as the chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), a carnivorous marsupial.  Jarrah has shown considerable adaptation to different ecologic zones - as in the Swan Coastal Plain and further north, and also to a different habitat of the lateritic Darling Scarp.   Jarrah is very vulnerable to dieback, the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes root-rot. In large sections of the Darling Scarp there have been various measures to reduce the spread of dieback by washing down vehicles, and restricting access to areas of forest not yet infected.  Uses  Jarrah produces a dark, thick, tasty honey, but its wood is its main use. It is a heavy wood, with a specific gravity of 1.1 when green. Its long, straight trunks of richly coloured and beautifully grained termite-resistant timber make it valuable for cabinet making, flooring, panelling and outdoor furniture. The finished lumber has a deep rich reddish-brown colour and an attractive grain. When fresh, jarrah is quite workable but when seasoned it becomes so hard that conventional wood-working tools are near useless on it.  It is very durable and water resistant, making it a choice structural material for bridges, wharves, railway sleepers, ship building and telegraph poles.  Jarrah wood is very similar to that of Karri, Eucalyptus diversicolor. Both trees are found in the southwest of Australia, and the two woods are frequently confused. They can be distinguished by cutting an unweathered splinter and burning it: karri burns completely to a white ash, whereas jarrah forms charcoal. Most of the best jarrah has been logged in southwestern Australia.  A large amount was exported to the United Kingdom, where it was cut into blocks and covered with asphalt for roads. One of the large exporters in the late nineteenth century was M. C. Davies who had mills from the Margaret River to the Augusta region of the southwest, and ports at Hamelin Bay and Flinders Bay.  The local poet Dryblower Murphy wrote a poem in the early twentieth century about the potential to extract alcohol from jarrah timber \"Comeanavajarrah\",  suggesting that the resource was an endless one for exploitation.  Jarrah has become more highly prized, and supports an industry that recycles it from demolished houses. Even so, in 2004, old 4 by recycled jarrah was routinely advertised in Perth papers for under $1.50 per metre.

Jonathan Demme, who had scored a string of critical successes with offbeat films like \"Handle With Care,\" \"Melvin and Howard,' \"Something Wild\" and \"Swimming to Cambodia,\" was named best director.  In a rambling and nervous acceptance speech, Mr. Demme, who moved into the mainstream in 1988 with \"Married to the Mob,\" thanked the film makers Hal Ashby and Martin Ritt as important early influences.  For his chilling performance as the psychotic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" Anthony Hopkins won the Oscar for best actor. Mr. Hopkins, who made his way to the stage amid a thunderous ovation, paid tribute to the four other nominees in his category and thanked his family, which was watching the awards ceremony in Wales. His victory marks the third year in a row that a British actor has won in the best-actor category. A Second for Foster  The film grabbed both of the top acting prizes, since a few minutes later Jodie Foster was named best actress for her performance as Clarice Starling, the rookie F.B.I. agent who matches wits with Dr. Lecter in her pursuit of a serial killer. Ms. Foster, her voice shaking with emotion, thanked the academy \"for embracing such a strong feminist hero that I'm proud to have portrayed.\"  It was the second Oscar as best actress for Ms. Foster, who won in 1988 for her performance in \"The Accused.\" She had been nominated for best supporting actress in 1976 for \"Taxi Driver.\"  \"The Silence of the Lambs\" completed its sweep when Ted Talley won for his screen adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel of the same name. The \"Lambs\" victory stood in marked contrast to \"Bugsy,\" which entered the evening with 10 nominations, more than any other film, but won in only two minor categories, for art direction and costume design. Similarly, Oliver Stone's controversial \"J.F.K.,\" with eight nominations, took home only two Oscars, for cinematography and film editing.  Jack Palance won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role for his performance as the leathery cowpoke in \"City Slickers.\" Mr. Palance, who was last nominated for an Academy Award in 1953 for his supporting role in \"Shane,\" gave one of the evening's more memorable aceptance speeches, beginning with an unprintable joke and breaking off to perform several one-arm push-ups at stage center. A Thank-You to Joseph Papp  Mercedes Ruehl, who played the brassy but warmhearted video-store owner in \"The Fisher King,\" received the award for best actress in a supporting role. In her acceptance speech, Ms. Ruehl paid tribute to the late Joseph Papp, who, she said, gave her her start on the New York stage and \"edged me out of the shadows into the spotlight and told me to stay there.\"  The Oscar for best original screenplay went to Callie Khouri for \"Thelma and Louise.\"  Many of the presenters and awards recipients, as well as Billy Crystal, the master of ceremonies for the event, wore a red lapel ribbon as a symbol of support for AIDS victims, and the disease provided a somber leitmotif to the evening.

{"input": "Context: Ornithology - The science of study of Birds - Bird ...Ornithology - The science of study of Birds - Bird Watching - Birding in India  Upupiformes  Ornithology (from Greek ornitha = chicken and logos = word/science) is a branch of Zoology or Biology concerned with the scientific study of birds , creatures belonging to class Aves. Aristotle was perhaps the first person who wrote on ornithology and mentions more than 170 birds. The earliest known use of the word Ornithology seems to be in the third edition of Blotints Glossographia (1670). John Ray (I628-1705) wrote the path-breaking Ornithologia in 1676 and the Synopsis Methodica Avium in 1713. Carolus Linnaeus (1758) was the pioneer in developing a classification system for birds and animals. He proposed the classification of animals into groups that had things in common. His scientific classification system, with some modification is still being used.  The science of Ornithology includes the study of classification of birds , evolution , body structure, habits, song, flight and breeding behavior. Birds are generally divided into two major groups. Ostriches, Emus, and Kiwis are ratites, flightless birds that lack keel-like extension on the breast bone. The vast majority of the birds, however, are non-ratites and possess the keel to which the powerful muscles that power the wings are attached. There are over 9200 extant species of birds divided into 30 orders & 174 families. Their ability to fly has allowed them to colonize every land mass on earth including the Arctic and Antarctic and some, like the Penguins have adapted an aquatic lifestyle coming to shore only to breed and raise young. Fossil evidence of the ancestors of modern birds indicates that they were contemporaneous with dinosaurs.  Classifying Bird Species:  The scientific name of a species has two parts. The first name describes the Genus and the second describes the bird specie. The second name may also be a person's name -- often the name of the ornithologist that first discovered the bird. This naming system is called the Binomial nomenclature and a more modern Trinomial nomenclature is now being used in which the third name describes the sub-species.  There is some evidence to suggest that these feathered creatures are in fact the highly evolved living incarnation of the reptiles (see: The Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin). This long evolutionary history has allowed for the development of the many unique morphological, physical and behavioral attributes in birds that make the science of ornithology such an interesting vocation.  As scientists learn more about birds, they are able to arrange the 10,000+ species of birds into the correct Order, Family and Genus. There is a surprising amount of debate about some birds. Are they really a species or not? They may actually be a race of a similar species in the same genus. Combining two apparent species into just one new species is called \"lumping\". Separating a species into two or more species is called \"splitting\". This \"splitting\" and 'lumping' of species is becoming more frequent today as DNA research is used.  Scientific classification is undergoing a big change. Dr. Charles G. Sibley did research for over twenty years using DNA from bird's blood. He and his associates suggested a new way to classify the birds of the world. His system is called the Sibley/Ahlquist/Monroe classification . Dr. Sibley discovered that some species are more closely related than thought earlier. He also rearranged Orders and Families in an unexpected new way. Additional research being done today is proving that Dr. Sibley is probably right. The SAM classification seems, to many scientists, to be better than the one used for the last 100 years. Scientists want to be very sure this new system is better than the traditional classification before they make an official change.  Dr Salim Ali (1896 - 1987) was India's most well-known Ornithologist and bird watcher. Today there are many scientists or ornithologists investigating birds. It is certain that their work will make bird species appear and disappear as they continue lumping and splitting.

In 1924, an Atlanta dry cleaner named W. J. Stoddard worked with Lloyd E. Jackson of the Mellon Research Institute to develop specifications for a less volatile dry cleaning solvent as an alternative to more volatile petroleum solvents. Dry cleaners began using it in 1928 and it was the predominant dry cleaning solvent in the United States from the late 1920s until the late 1950s.  It is a mixture of saturated aliphatic and alicyclic C7 to C12 hydrocarbons with a maximum content of 25% of C7 to C12 alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons .  White spirit is used as an extraction solvent, as a cleaning solvent, as a degreasing solvent and as a solvent in aerosols , paints , wood preservatives, lacquers , varnishes , and asphalt products.  In western Europe about 60% of the total white spirit consumption is used in paints, lacquers and varnishes.  White spirit is the most widely used solvent in the paint industry. In households, white spirit is commonly used to clean paint brushes after decorating. Its paint thinning properties enable brushes to be properly cleaned (by preventing the paint from hardening and ruining the bristles) and therefore enabling them to be re-used.  Three different types and three different grades of white spirit exist. The type refers to whether the solvent has been subjected to hydrodesulfurization (removal of sulfur) alone (type 1), solvent extraction (type 2) or hydrogenation (type 3).  Each type comprises three different grades: low flash grade, regular grade, and high flash grade.  The grade is determined by the crude oil used as the starting material and the conditions of distillation.

{"input": "Context: In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries. However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school.

Hawley Harvey Crippen and Ethel Le Neve on trial in London.  George Grantham Bain Collection/Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. ( LC-DIG-ggbain-08612)  Crippen was a homeopathic physician in New York City when he wed Cora Turner (who later took the stage name Belle Elmore) in 1892. In contrast to her meek, gentle, diminutive husband, Cora Crippen was intimidating and extravagant. After they moved to London in 1897, she performed as a music hall singer and also had affairs with several other men, while he sold patent medicines. He was aided in his business by a young secretary, Ethel Le Neve, who eventually became his mistress. Crippen\u2019s wife disappeared in January 1910, the month after telling him she planned to leave him and to withdraw their savings from the bank. Crippen explained her disappearance to her friends by saying that she had gone on a visit to the United States; later he published an announcement that she had died there. Meanwhile, Le Neve moved into the Crippen house and accompanied the doctor in public wearing Cora Crippen\u2019s jewelry and furs.  Suspicions were raised, and Crippen received a visit from Inspector Walter Dew of Scotland Yard . Crippen told the police that his wife had left him to live with another man. By the time Dew visited the Crippen house a second time, the doctor and his secretary had fled. Dew ordered a thorough search of the house, which led to the discovery of partial human remains in a hole in the basement. An autopsy and forensic analysis identified the remains as those of Cora Crippen, who had been poisoned, then dismembered. In July 1910 Crippen\u2014unaware that his crime had made a sensation in the British press\u2014boarded the SS Montrose to Canada with Le Neve, who wore boy\u2019s clothes and pretended to be his son. The ship\u2019s captain recognized the pair and notified his superiors via the recently developed technology of wireless telegraphy, marking the first time this technology was used to track a criminal and riveting the world\u2019s attention to the ensuing chase. Dew pursued and overtook the fugitive pair on a faster ship to Canada, where he arrested them. The couple were returned to London, where they went on trial in October 1910.

Fast forward 19 months and Susan Boyle has been watched at least 400 million times on YouTube, appeared on Oprah and even sung for the pope (sort of: he made a break for the popemobile before she really got going at Glasgow's Bellahouston Park this September).  To that list of achievements we can now add being as popular as the Beatles. Unlike numerous overhyped musicians over the years, Boyle has never claimed to want to be as big as McCartney and co \u2013 she fancied herself as the new Elaine Page.  But she has managed it anyway, by having the No 1 album in the US and UK at the same time for the second time in a year.

This is an amazing result and one I never expected.\"  Boyle was catapulted from obscurity to global stardom after appearing on last year's Britain's Got Talent contest. The singer, from Blackburn in West Lothian, became an international star after her performance of I Dreamed a Dream from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables stunned the audience and judges on the ITV1 show.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

In the original film, Ann is played by Fay Wray ; in the 2005 remake, she is played by Naomi Watts ; in an unauthorized 1998 animated musical film, The Mighty Kong , she is voiced by Jodi Benson. The 1976 remake features an analogous character named \" Dwan \" (played by Jessica Lange ), in the Melbourne stage production in Australia, she is played by Esther Hannaford. The character of Ann Darrow never appears in any other films or television productions of King Kong, yet has been seen in the King Kong Comic books.  Contents  Edit  Ann Darrow is played by Naomi Watts in the 2005 film and has more detail. She was an actress, but lost that job when her studio went bankrupt in the Great Depression. Ann was apparently destitute, as she was shoplifting fruit and caught, but bailed out by Denham, who came to her rescue by paying for the fruit and telling her of his grand plans in film. She also declined Denham's invitation at first, but she then accepted the offer when she was told that Jack Driscoll was going along too. Jack also develops a crush on Ann and even kiss each other before arriving at Skull Island. Ann originally thought that the sound editor of Carl's film crew, Mike, was Jack. After seeing Mike die in front of her, Ann screams with horror. She was able to escape at first from the hostile natives at Skull Island, but was kidnapped from the boat and dragged to a sacrificial chamber in her bare feet and pajamas, where she is offered as a sacrifice to Kong by the natives. Kong takes her as Ann screams at the top of her lungs. She faints as Kong vanishes into the forest. Kong roars as Ann moans as she freaks out. Kong almost drops her as Ann shrieks and yells. She stabs Kong with her skull necklace as she falls onto the pile of skulls. She attempts to escape but Kong grabs her, causing her to shriek. Jack and Carl try to find her along with many other crewmembers. Ann is heard screaming. She woke up the next day, she saw Kong distracted by eating Bamboo sticks. she tried to escape but Kong stopped her. she was then treated like a Rag Doll because King Kong at first was either angry or curious about Ann, enjoyed her dancing and acting, and kept pushing her, making him happy and hooting. When Ann shown anger at him, he also got angry and Kong left her. At the time she escaped, she was unfortunate again because Vastosaurus Rexes wanted to eat her, and Kong saved her life.  Ann ambushed by the creatures of Skull Island  That night Jack comes to Kong's lair, and disturbs him from his slumber, then a swarm of flying Terapus mordax attacks them. Kong ends up battling the giant bats, the attack resulted in Ann losing her dressing gown for unknown reasons (but it most likely her shirt was torn off by one of the Terapus mordax, this forced Ann to continue the journey wearing her pink slip dress only), Kong puts Ann in safety while he battles the giant bats, As Kong fights the swarm of Terapus mordax, Ann and Jack escape by grabbing the wing of one of the bats and then jumping into a river. They arrive at the village wall, with the angry Kong following them.  When Carl and the other crew men were done with their own problems in the island with most of them dead, they captured and kidnapped King Kong. Captain Englehorn was about to kill King Kong with a sharp harpoon but she begged and cried out to let Kong live. but they succesfully captured Kong, Ann simply stared at Kong before she broke down in tears due to have been unable to help kong from getting captured, Carl takes Kong to New York, and he escapes in an angry mood destroying the ampitheater he was taken to. | Question: In the 2005 remake of the film 'King Kong' who played the part of Ann Darrow, originally played by Fay Wray?", "truth": ["naomi watts"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4087", "mistake": "Naomi Watts", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Such widespread popularity is a double-edged sword: The Four Seasons\u2019s ubiquity in popular culture has too often presented as harmless background music a fiendishly inventive work by a composer of terrific originality.  The concertos that make up The Four Seasons (Le quattro stagioni) appeared as the first four of twelve violin concertos published as Il cimento dell\u2019armonia e dell\u2019inventione (The Contest between Harmony and Invention), Opus 8. Vivaldi composed them to accompany a set of four sonnets\u2014\u201cLa primavera,\u201d \u201cL\u2019estate,\u201d \u201cL\u2019autunno,\u201d and \u201cL\u2019inverno\u201d\u2014whose authorship is uncertain but generally attributed to Vivaldi himself. The sonnets\u2019 tripartite structures align with the three movements of each concerto, which in turn provide vivid musical depictions of the corresponding text.  The Four Seasons evinces Vivaldi\u2019s importance to the development of the Baroque concerto. His contributions to the genre, which total more than five hundred, defined the concerto form as a dialog between soloist and ensemble and established certain formal characteristics as standards in concerto writing. (They also established the concerto as a vehicle for instrumental virtuosity\u2014fittingly so, given Vivaldi\u2019s stature as one of the finest violinists of his generation; more than two hundred of Vivaldi\u2019s concertos are for violin.) Vivaldi\u2019s concertos served as significant models for no less than Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concertos, among other major works of the Baroque period.  But of equal importance to the formal innovations manifested in works like The Four Seasons are the breadth of their dramatic character and the extent of Vivaldi\u2019s vision in imagining the expressive potential of the concerto form. The Four Seasons concertos are remarkable for their illustration of their subject matter, whether in depicting hunting horns and guns in \u201cAutumn\u201d or in the chilling texture of \u201cWinter\u201d, mimetic of the \u201ccold in the icy snow/In the harsh breath of a horrid wind.\u201d  Patrick Castillo \u00a92016  About This Program  The SPCO celebrates the changing seasons with two musical expressions of the natural cycles that surround us. Vivaldi\u2019s cherished work, The Four Seasons, animates the unique and wondrous energies of each season as the composer experienced them in 18th century Italy. Two centuries later, Argentine composer \u00c1stor Piazzolla wrote The Four Season of Buenos Aires, crafting a work evoking the seasons through his ingenious manipulation of the tango, the musical heartbeat of Argentina.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. | Question: Western Imperialism divided the globe according to which theory?", "truth": ["the world systems theory", "world systems theory.", "world systems theory"], "id": "mrqa_squad-validation-10043", "mistake": "world systems theory", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty. | Question: By 1897, how much had Tesla, Brown, and Peck received in royalties and licenses over the patents?", "truth": ["an estimated $200,000", "$200,000", "estimated $200,000"], "id": "mrqa_squad-validation-1330", "mistake": "an estimated $200,000", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

In 1939, she scored one of her greatest on-screen successes with The Wizard of Oz. In 1950, MGM dropped her from her contract. In the 1960s, Judy Garland spent more time as a singer than an actress.

Position, Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration as Vectors  Position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration can all be shown vectors since they are defined in terms of a magnitude and a direction.  Learning Objective  Examine the applications of vectors in analyzing physical quantities  Key Points  Vectors are arrows consisting of a magnitude and a direction. They are used in physics to represent physical quantities that also have both magnitude and direction.  Displacement is a physics term meaning the distance of an object from a reference point. Since the displacement contains two pieces of information: the distance from the reference point and the direction away from the point, it is well represented by a vector.  Velocity is defined as the rate of change in time of the displacement. To know the velocity of an object one must know both how fast the displacement is changing and in what direction. Therefore it is also well represented by a vector.  Acceleration , being the rate of change of velocity also requires both a magnitude and a direction relative to some coordinates .  When drawing vectors, you often do not have enough space to draw them to the scale they are representing, so it is important to denote somewhere what scale they are being drawn at.  Terms  The rate of change of displacement with respect to change in time.  Example  Figure 1 shows an example of how to use a vector to visually represent an object in physics.  Full Text  Use of Vectors  Vectors can be used to represent physical quantities. Most commonly in physics, vectors are used to represent displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Vectors are a combination of magnitude and direction, and are drawn as arrows. The length represents the magnitude and the direction of that quantity is the direction in which the vector is pointing. Because vectors are constructed this way, it is helpful to analyze physical quantities (with both size and direction) as vectors.  Applications  In physics, vectors are useful because they can visually represent position , displacement, velocity and acceleration. When drawing vectors, you often do not have enough space to draw them to the scale they are representing, so it is important to denote somewhere what scale they are being drawn at. For example, when drawing a vector that represents a magnitude of 100, one may draw a line that is 5 units long at a scale of  $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{20}$  . When the inverse of the scale is multiplied by the drawn magnitude, it should equal the actual magnitude.  Position and Displacement  Displacement is defined as the distance, in any direction, of an object relative to the position of another object. Physicists use the concept of a position vector as a graphical tool to visualize displacements. A position vector expresses the position of an object from the origin of a coordinate system. A position vector can also be used to show the position of an object in relation to a reference point, secondary object or initial position (if analyzing how far the object has moved from its original location). The position vector is a straight line drawn from the arbitrary origin to the object. Once drawn, the vector has a length and a direction relative to the coordinate system used.  Velocity  Velocity is also defined in terms of a magnitude and direction. To say that something is gaining or losing velocity one must also say how much and in what direction. For example, an airplane flying at 200  $\\frac{km}{h}$  to the northeast can be represented by an vector pointing in the northeast direction with a magnitude of 200  $\\frac{km}{h}$  . In drawing the vector, the magnitude is only important as | Question: In physics, 'the rate of change of position' is a basic definition of what term?", "truth": ["velocity", "velocity vector"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2163", "mistake": "Velocity", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Zweifel  Paul F. Zweifel  PROGRAM NOTES FOR GILBERT AND SULLIVAN SHOW  Opera Roanoke, April 26, 1998  This afternoon we are presenting excerpts from two of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular operettas, Patience and H.M.S. Pinafore. In the first of these,  Patience, the village milkmaid, is loved by the poet Reginald Bunthorne, who is in turn loved by twenty lovesick maidens. The maidens are, however, loved by the members of the 35th Dragoon Guards, led by Col. Calverly. Eventually everybody finds a mate except for Bunthorne (which is rather strange since the subtitle of the operetta is Bunthornes's Bride).  Patience  actually contains more direct contemporary satire than any other of the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. Its target was the aesthetic movement which flourished in Britain between 1870 and the mid-1880's, and introduced the new religion of beauty as a reaction against the ugliness of the Victorian age.  The principal male cast members are parodies of Victorian poets. Reginald Bunthorne, the Fleshly Poet, is a thinly-disguised portrait of Oscar Wilde, while it is believed that Archibald Grosvenor, the Idyllic Poet, represents Algernon Swineburne.  Certainly, the aesthetic movement was more affected than most, and lent itself naturally to ridicule and satire. In 1878, Oscar Wilde, who personified more than any other person the excesses of aestheticism, arrived in London from Oxford, clutching his sacred lily, waxing enthusiastic about blue and white china and the paintings of the pre-Raphaelites and describing Henry Irving's legs as \"distinctly precious.\"  Shortly after, Wilde made a lecture tour of the United States, always walking to the podium dressed in aesthetic, velvety clothes and clutching a lily in his hand. This tour, of course, was promoted by Rupert D'Oyly Carte, the Gilbert and Sullivan impresario, as a promotion for the operetta's upcoming tour in the U.S.  Gilbert's original sketch for Patience involved two curates (assistant pastors of the Church of England); this sketch actually was published as a Bab Ballad entitled \"The Rival Curates.\" Being persuaded that this subject matter might be considered offensive by the Victorian public, Gilbert changed the protagonists to poets. A vestige of the original version remains in the first act finale, when Bunthorne proposes to raffle himself off \"in aid of a deserving charity.\"  Patience had its premiere on April 23, 1881, and was an instant success. Among the eight numbers which were encored that night were the lovely madrigal \"I hear the soft note;\" the duet \"Prithee pretty maiden;\" and other numbers  which are on this afternoon's agenda.  H.M.S. Pinafore or The Lass that Loved a Sailor has a plot more akin to that of the typical Italian Opera. The soprano, Josephine (Captain  Corcoran's daughter) and the tenor, Ralph Rackstraw (a sailor on the Captain's ship) are in love and want to get married. Three baritones--the Captain, Sir Joseph (the Ruler of the Queens Navee) and the hideously ugly sailor Dick Deadeye--do their worst to prevent the match. But omnia vincit amor, with a little help from the bumboat woman, Little Buttercup.  H.M.S. Pinafore was Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth opera, and their first great success.

Rob Pilatus (left) and Fab Morvan (right). (September 27, 1988).\u00a0 (Photo by Michael Putland/Getty Images)  Share  By Jennifer Rosenberg  When the pop-music duo Milli Vanilli released their album Girl You Know It\u2019s True in early 1989, they skyrocketed to fame, selling 14 million albums worldwide. Over the next year, Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan wowed audiences with their good looks, long hair, and catchy tunes. They won awards and had millions of fans. However, that all ended when producer Frank Farian announced on November 14, 1990 that Pilatus and Morvan had been lip-synching the whole time. Milli Vanilli is now considered one of the music industry\u2019s biggest hoaxes.  Who Were Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan?  Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan were two dark-skinned, European, young men who were na\u00efve enough to sign a contract that would make them famous and destroy them at the same time.  Robert Pilatus was born in 1965 in Munich , the son of a black U.S. soldier and a German stripper. As an infant, he was put up for adoption and adopted by a German family.  Fabrice Morvan had a more stable childhood.  continue reading below our video  10 Best Universities in the United States  Born in 1966 to architect and pharmacist parents, he grew up in Paris and became an outstanding trampoline athlete until an injury prevented him from continuing.  The two, handsome, energetic, physically-fit, young men met in Munich and became friends. While trying to find a niche for themselves as either models, singers, or dancers, they came across German record producer Frank Farian. Tempted by the possibility of fame and success, Pilatus and Morvan signed Farian\u2019s contract.  Stardom  Farian had a number of singers that sounded great but didn\u2019t have the look of stars. Then he found Pilatus and Morvan who looked like stars but couldn\u2019t sing. He put the two together to form Milli Vanilli (the name reportedly from an old Berlin disco).  The anonymous in-house singers (now known to include John Davis, Brad Howell, and Charles Shaw), sang the songs and then Pilatus and Morvan would appear on the cover of the album and lip-synch and dance during live performances.  When the album Girl You Know It\u2019s True was released in the U.S. in early 1989, it included ten songs, five of which reached Billboard\u2019s top five. These popular songs included:  \u201cBaby Don\u2019t Forget My Number\u201d (reached #1)  \u201cGirl I\u2019m Gonna Miss You\u201d (reached #1)  \u201cGirl You Know It\u2019s True\u201d (reached #2)  \u201cAll or Nothing\u201d (reached #4)  With such popular songs, Pilatus and Morvan were in hot demand for live performances.  A Technical Problem Reveals All  It was during one such live performance that Pilatus and Morvan\u2019s lip-synching was revealed. On July 21, 1989, Pilatus and Morvan were performing live as Milli Vanilli in front of 80,000 fans at Lake Compounce, an amusement park in Bristol, Connecticut, as part of the MTV Club tour when there was a technical difficulty.

{"input": "Context: What is the mythological lion with wings called ...What is the mythological lion with wings called? | Reference.com  What is the mythological lion with wings called?  A:  Quick Answer  In Greek, Near Eastern and other mythologies, the creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle is called a griffin. It symbolizes a mastery of both earth and sky and is associated with strength and wisdom.  Full Answer  In Greek mythology, the griffin pulls the chariots of both Zeus, the ruler of all gods, and Apollo, god of the sun. Since the griffin is a kingly beast on earth with the strength of a lion but with the wings of an eagle that can soar to the sky, it is only appropriate that it is called upon to transport Apollo between heaven and earth.  Griffins are also considered fierce and loyal guards, used to defend stockpiles of gold and other treasures. Their images most frequently appear in tales of the Hyperboreans and Arimaspians, mythological peoples of the far north.  It is believed that the origins of the winged lion began in the Middle East, where its image is depicted in the paintings and sculptures of the ancient Assyrians, Babylonians and Persians. Later, the Romans used griffin likenesses as decorations, and the figure also appeared in early Christian art.  Ironically, to Christians, the griffin first symbolized Satan because the dual-animal creature was thought to threaten human souls. Eventually, however, the griffin's symbolic meaning as a figure of both earth and sky translated into the Christian view of the dual human and divine nature of Jesus Christ. The griffin then became a positive image in Christian lore and artwork  .  Beyond the mythological world, the griffin's symbolism as a figure of strength and wisdom made it a natural choice for coats of arms. The winged lion's likeness shows up in military and familial regalia from ancient to medieval times.  10 Legendary Greek Mythological Creatures - WondersList10 Legendary Greek Mythological Creatures  10 Legendary Greek Mythological Creatures  by Ejaz Khan  Belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices, Greek mythology is known for some extremely out of this world mythology. The Greek legends have been the subject of popular culture for thousands of years. The most famous characters in these myths are the gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines, and mythological creatures.  Below is a list of 10 Legendary Greek Mythological Creatures.  10. Typhon  Typhon was the most deadly monster of Greek mythology. The last son of Gaia, fathered by Tartarus, he was known as the \u201cFather of All Monsters\u201d; his wife Echidna was likewise the \u201cMother of All Monsters.\u201d He was described in pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke, as the largest and most fearsome of all creatures. His human upper half supposedly reached as high as the stars, and his hands reached east and west. Instead of a human head, a hundred dragon heads erupted from his neck and shoulders.  9. Lamia  Lamia was apparently a beautiful queen of Libya who became a child-eating daemon. In the myth, she is a mistress of the god Zeus, causing Zeus\u2019 jealous wife, Hera, to kill all of Lamia\u2019s children (except for Scylla, who is herself cursed) and transform her into a monster that hunts and devours the children of others. Another version has Hera merely stealing away all of Lamia\u2019s children and it being Lamia herself, losing her mind from grief and despair, who starts stealing and devouring others\u2019 children out of envy, the repeated monstrosity of which transforms her into a monster on its own.  8. Echidna  Half woman half snake, Echidna known as the \u201cMother of All Monsters\u201d because most of the monsters in Greek mythology were her offspring. Hesiod\u2019s Theogony described her as:\u00a0\u201cthe goddess fierce Echidna who is half a nymph with glancing eyes and fair cheeks, and half again a huge snake, great and awful, with speckled skin, eating raw flesh beneath the | Question: Which Greek mythological creature has the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle?", "truth": ["griffins", "griffin"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5609", "mistake": "griffin", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

{"input": "Context: Wildcats (1986) Starring: Goldie Hawn, Swoosie Kurtz ...Wildcats (1986) Starring: Goldie Hawn, Swoosie Kurtz, Robyn Lively - Three Movie Buffs Review  Reviewed on: January 16th, 2012  Goldie Hawn on the shoulders of Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in Wildcats.  Wildcats is a quintessential 1980s high school sports comedy. The music, fashion, cars and hairstyles are all unmistakably 80s. Large boom boxes are on display in several scenes and a student mentions a \u201ccompact disc player\u201d at one point. It stars Goldie Hawn as a dissatisfied suburban Chicago high school girl\u2019s track coach. Her dream is to coach football. When the junior varsity coach gets sacked, she applies for the position. Instead she is offered the job of coaching the varsity team at a tough inner-city school.  The expected fish-out-of-water jokes (or more accurately white-woman-coaching-minority-boy\u2019s jokes) ensue. She gets off to a rough start but with tenacity she eventually earns the team\u2019s respect and leads them to the championship game against the high school where she was formerly employed. Yes the plot is unoriginal and predictable. Fortunately the cast, lead by the always hilarious Goldie, makes the most of this tried and true formula.  As was common in comedies from the 1980s, Wildcats features several nude scenes. Goldie Hawn appears naked in a bathtub with her tits exposed and there is even a glimpse of full frontal male nudity, courtesy of two of the boys on the football team (Wesley Snipes and Jsu Garcia). Although these actors were both adults at the time, I doubt if a movie today would show a female teacher being given the full monty by her students. At least not in such a nonchalant manner as depicted here.  Also typical of 1980s comedies is the casual mix of raunchy humor with a feel-good family message. Words like fuck and pussy are thrown around as often as a football on the practice field, yet the movie contains a valuable life lesson about perseverance. And the plot also deals with Goldie Hawn\u2019s battle with her ex-husband to keep custody of her two daughters.  The supporting cast features many familiar faces. This was the debut of Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson and the first of their movies together. Nipsey Russell plays the supportive high school principal. Swoosie Kurtz plays Hawn\u2019s loyal sister. Mykelti Williamson plays the all star quarterback. Audiences will remember him as Forrest Gump\u2019s best friend Bubba. LL Cool J makes a cameo during a party scene and performs the theme song. Old-timers Gloria (Titanic) Stuart and Ann Doran (she appeared in small roles in many classic films, dating back to the 1922 silent version of Robin Hood!) play the conservative women that interview Goldie for a job at a private school.

Welch was a roller derby girl; Streisand played a boxing manager and Hawn a high school football coach.

{"input": "Context: East of Eden - Book Clubs - Penguin Books USAEast of Eden by John Steinbeck - Reading Guide - PenguinRandomHouse.com  Questions and Topics for Discussion  INTRODUCTION  East of Eden, John Steinbeck\u2019s passionate and exhilarating epic, re-creates the seminal stories of Genesis through the intertwined lives of two American families. The result is a purely American saga set in Steinbeck\u2019s own childhood home, the Salinas Valley of northern California. The valley is a new world both idyllic and harsh, and Steinbeck sings to it with a personal nostalgia that is clouded by the knowledge that this valley-as all human dwellings-is the location for as much tragedy as triumph.  The first family whose story is told in this novel is the Hamiltons, led by the charismatic poet-patriarch Samuel Hamilton, an Irish immigrant who raises a large and boisterous family on a mean and unyielding plot of land through charm, ingenuity, and adaptability. The Hamiltons are penniless, but Samuel and Liza\u2019s strong and traditional marriage yields nine children of every type and talent who brim with affection and potential. The children act out the numerous possibilities of American life, some making money in business and advertising, some seeking love and home life, others failing utterly in their struggle to find meaning and clarity in the chaotic possibility of a new century.  The second family, the Trasks, is introduced to us as a Connecticut father-a false war hero with a fortune of mysterious origin-his used-up wives, and his two sons: the murderous Charles and the sensitive, searching Adam. After a stint in the army and aimless years as a hobo, Adam falls in love and migrates to Salinas, intending to create his own Garden of Eden. There he presides over a fractured home, raising twin sons Caleb and Aron alone after the dissolution of his marriage to the unfathomable, treacherous Catherine Ames. Catherine herself-later known as Kate-represents the potential for evil in the world. Her life in the valley is the antithesis of that which the Trasks and Hamiltons seek to achieve, as she sinks into a limited life of meanness.  The Trasks are what Steinbeck called his \u201csymbol people,\u201d and their story reenacts the saga of Cain and Abel, for Steinbeck one of the world\u2019s greatest stories of love, rejection, jealousy, and redemption. But Adam and his sons are held together as a family by the Chinese-American philosopher-servant Lee, who offers wisdom in the face of painful circumstances. Together the characters try to formulate personal paradises that can withstand the inevitable challenges of human existence, battling the contradiction between the desire to submit to God and tradition and the human need for self-realization and fulfillment. Much as the United States itself had to resolve its roots in Europe as it absorbed the labor of immigrants from around the world in the creation of a new nation, East of Eden\u2018s path-breaking Americans seek to free themselves from the chains of the past and achieve personal freedom.  A brilliant novel of ideas, East of Eden is far-reaching in its effort to explicate the most fundamental trials of mankind. Brutally realistic-and sometimes fatalistic-about people\u2019s ability to harm themselves and those around them, it is also a celebration of perseverance, enduring love, and the noble yearning to better oneself. And it is a work of profound optimism about the capacity of humans to triumph over adversity and determine their own fates. In prose both evanescent and dignified, Steinbeck creates in these characters and for the reader \u201ca new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe. It is always attacked and never destroyed.\u201d  ABOUT JOHN STEINBECK  No writer is more quintessentially American than John Steinbeck. Born in 1902 in Salinas, California, Steinbeck attended Stanford University before working at a series of mostly blue-collar jobs and embarking on his literary career. Profoundly committed to social progress, he used his writing to raise issues of labor exploitation and the plight of the common man, penning some of the greatest American novels of the twentieth century and winning such prestigious awards as the | Question: In what classic novel are the two principal male characters called Cal and Aron ?", "truth": ["east of eden", "aron trask", "cal trask"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1945", "mistake": "East of Eden", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Kennedy, is shot to death by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner.  On November 22, President Kennedy was fatally shot while riding in an open-car motorcade through the streets of downtown Dallas. Less than an hour after the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald killed a policeman who questioned him on the street. Thirty minutes after that, he was arrested in a movie theater by police. Oswald was formally arraigned on November 23 for the murders of President Kennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit.  On November 24, Oswald was brought to the basement of the Dallas police headquarters on his way to a more secure county jail. A crowd of police and press with live television cameras rolling gathered to witness his departure. As Oswald came into the room, Jack Ruby emerged from the crowd and fatally wounded him with a single shot from a concealed .38 revolver. Ruby, who was immediately detained, claimed that rage at Kennedy\u2019s murder was the motive for his action. Some called him a hero, but he was nonetheless charged with first-degree murder.  Jack Ruby, originally known as Jacob Rubenstein, operated strip joints and dance halls in Dallas and had minor connections to organized crime. He also had a relationship with a number of Dallas policemen, which amounted to various favors in exchange for leniency in their monitoring of his establishments. He features prominently in Kennedy-assassination theories, and many believe he killed Oswald to keep him from revealing a larger conspiracy. In his trial, Ruby denied the allegation and pleaded innocent on the grounds that his great grief over Kennedy\u2019s murder had caused him to suffer \u201cpsychomotor epilepsy\u201d and shoot Oswald unconsciously. The jury found him guilty of the \u201cmurder with malice\u201d of Oswald and sentenced him to die.  In October 1966, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the decision on the grounds of improper admission of testimony and the fact that Ruby could not have received a fair trial in Dallas at the time. In January 1967, while awaiting a new trial, to be held in Wichita Falls, Ruby died of lung cancer in a Dallas hospital.  The official Warren Commission report of 1964 concluded that neither Oswald nor Ruby were part of a larger conspiracy, either domestic or international, to assassinate President Kennedy. Despite its seemingly firm conclusions, the report failed to silence conspiracy theories surrounding the event, and in 1978 the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in a preliminary report that Kennedy was \u201cprobably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\u201d that may have involved multiple shooters and organized crime. The committee\u2019s findings, as with those of the Warren Commission, continue to be widely disputed.

The Romans identified her with their own Juno . Hera was worshipped throughout the Greek world and played an important part in Greek literature, appearing most frequently as the jealous and rancorous wife of Zeus and pursuing with vindictive hatred the heroines who were beloved by him. From early times Hera was believed to be the sole lawful wife of Zeus; she soon superseded Dione , who shared with him his ancient oracle at Dodona in Epirus.  Head of Hera, sculpture from the votive group in the Heraeum at Olympia; in the Archaeological \u2026  Foto Marburg  In general, Hera was worshipped in two main capacities: (1) as consort of Zeus and queen of heaven and (2) as goddess of marriage and of the life of women. The second sphere naturally made her the protectress of women in childbirth , and she bore the title of Eileithyia , the birth goddess, at Argos and Athens. At Argos and Samos, however, Hera was even more than queen of heaven and marriage goddess. She was patron of those cities, which gave her a position corresponding to that of Athena at Athens. Although her Argive ritual was markedly agricultural, she also had a celebration there called the Shield, and there was an armed procession in her honour at Samos. This conception resulted from the breadth of functions attributed to the patron deity of a Greek state: a city goddess must be chief in peace and war alike. The animal especially sacred to Hera was the cow. Her sacred bird was first the cuckoo , later the peacock . She was represented as a majestic and severe, though youthful, matron. See also Zeus .

Originally he was a god of the skies and high heavens and back in the day Greeks thought of him as the only god who concerned himself with the entire universe.  Greeks associated Zeus with justice and  well being.  He's believed to have greatly punished the wicked and maldoers and rewarded all that did good.  He received the lightening bolt from the Cyclops who were the giants that helped Zeus in the war against his father.  He uses the lightening bolt for defence along with a bright golden shield with an eagle engraved in it.  Zeus was the son of the great god Cronus and great goddess Rhea.  Cronus feared his children would want to overpower him and take his place at Mt.Olympus, therefore he swallowed all of Zeus's siblings, Zeus hadn't yet been born.  When Zeus was born, Rhea hid Zeus on some close by islands before Cronus could swallow him then she wrapped a stone in baby's clothes and gave it to Cronus. Cronus swallowed it believing it was his son.

With such heart felt ballads as \"If I Loved You\" and \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" it definitely ranks as one of the essential Hollywood musicals. Carousel is just about the only musical made during this period that deals with darker themes (i.e. date rape, domestic abuse). One could say that it even argues in favor of birth control. Carousel will never look dated because its themes are timeless and apply to the human spirit no matter what year it is. Everybody can identify with Billy to a degree and everybody can not help but feel a deep respect for Julie by the end of her personal journey. Fans of musical drama will treasure Carousel for years to come.  excellent Rodgers and Hammerstein musical  Reviewed bydidi-5Vote: 5/10  This is the musical which gave Gordon MacRae his greatest solo song, namely the 7 minutes long \"Soliloquy\", in which Billy the circus barker speculates about his unborn child, first with bluster and pride if it is a boy, and then with insecurity and despair if it is a girl he can't buy things for.  Billy, as we have seen in the opening sequence of the film, is telling his story to one of the angels in heaven, where he has gone after a violent and premature death.  So we see his tale unfold, as he meets pretty little Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones, excellent), marries her, and through fate and bad luck, gets separated from her.    The subject matter is darker than Oklahoma (the film version of which also starred MacRae and Jones) but the sheer exuberance of songs such as \"June is Bustin' Out All Over\"; \"A Real Nice Clambake\"; \"When The Children Are Asleep\" and \"If I Loved You\", plus of course the best-known song from the show, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" takes the story to another level and makes this film enjoyable to watch.  Robert Rounsville makes a fine bombastic Mr Snow and has a fabulous voice; MacRae and Jones have their memorable duet to the lovely melody of Rodgers' score.  There is also an excellent dance sequence, not as extensive as on stage, but still effective, where the daughter of Billy and Julie imagines an escape from her lonely and ostracised life.  Classic R&H Musical With Superb MacRae and Jones...  Reviewed byNeil DoyleVote: 5/10  Rodgers & Hammerstein's brilliant stage musical comes to the screen with most of the music intact--and what songs they are. Each one is a gem and fully integrated into the tragic storyline. Gordon MacRae stars as Billy Bigelow, the amusement park barker who tries to change his life when he marries Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones)-- with tragic results. MacRae's robust baritone is showcased in his big number, 'Soliloquy', performed at seaside with the ocean backdrop. Only occasionally is the use of stagebound sets a jarring note--but overall, the look and feel of the movie is one of genuinely moving musical drama.  Delightful performances from Barbara Ruick and Robert Rounseville as Mr. and Mrs. Snow. Their 'When The Children Are Asleep' is a charming highlight. Claramae Turner does an outstanding job on 'You'll Never Walk Alone'. Cameron Mitchell is a slyly villainous Jigger. Filming of the 'June Is Bustin' Out All Over' number in Boothsbay Harbor, Maine is a production highlight and choreographer's dream.  Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones are in excellent voice for 'If I Loved You'. What more could you want? An exceptional movie musical that ranks with the best of Rodgers & Hammerstein's works.

U.S. stateA state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names.  States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.   States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals.  States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.

{"input": "Context: October 25, 1881 : Pablo Picasso born - History.comOctober 25, 1881 : Pablo Picasso born  Introduction  Pablo Picasso, one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, is born in Malaga, Spain.  Picasso\u2019s father was a professor of drawing, and he bred his son for a career in academic art. Picasso had his first exhibit at age 13 and later quit art school so he could experiment full-time with modern art styles. He went to Paris for the first time in 1900, and in 1901 was given an exhibition at a gallery on Paris\u2019 rue Lafitte, a street known for its prestigious art galleries. The precocious 19-year-old Spaniard was at the time a relative unknown outside Barcelona, but he had already produced hundreds of paintings. Winning favorable reviews, he stayed in Paris for the rest of the year and later returned to the city to settle permanently.  The work of Picasso, which comprises more than 50,000 paintings, drawings, engravings, sculptures, and ceramics produced over 80 years, is described in a series of overlapping periods. His first notable period\u2013the \u201cblue period\u201d\u2014began shortly after his first Paris exhibit. In works such as The Old Guitarist (1903), Picasso painted in blue tones to evoke the melancholy world of the poor. The blue period was followed by the \u201crose period,\u201d in which he often depicted circus scenes, and then by Picasso\u2019s early work in sculpture. In 1907, Picasso painted the groundbreaking work Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon, which, with its fragmented and distorted representation of the human form, broke from previous European art. Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon demonstrated the influence on Picasso of both African mask art and Paul Cezanne and is seen as a forerunner of the Cubist movement, founded by Picasso and the French painter Georges Braque in 1909.  In Cubism, which is divided into two phases, analytical and synthetic, Picasso and Braque established the modern principle that artwork need not represent reality to have artistic value. Major Cubist works by Picasso included his costumes and sets for Sergey Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes (1917) and The Three Musicians (1921). Picasso and Braque\u2019s Cubist experiments also resulted in the invention of several new artistic techniques, including collage.  After Cubism, Picasso explored classical and Mediterranean themes, and images of violence and anguish increasingly appeared in his work. In 1937, this trend culminated in the masterpiece Guernica, a monumental work that evoked the horror and suffering endured by the Basque town of Guernica when it was destroyed by German war planes during the Spanish Civil War. Picasso remained in Paris during the Nazi occupation but was fervently opposed to fascism and after the war joined the French Communist Party.  Picasso\u2019s work after World War II is less studied than his earlier creations, but he continued to work feverishly and enjoyed commercial and critical success. He produced fantastical works, experimented with ceramics, and painted variations on the works of other masters in the history of art. Known for his intense gaze and domineering personality, he had a series of intense and overlapping love affairs in his lifetime. He continued to produce art with undiminished force until his death in 1973 at the age of 91.

Jobs stepped down in August as chief executive of the company he helped set up in 1976, citing illness. He had been battling an unusual form of pancreatic cancer, and had received a liver transplant in 2009.  Jobs wrote in his letter of resignation: \"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.\"  Apple released a statement paying tribute: \"Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives \u2026 The world is immeasurably better because of\u00a0Steve.\"  Bill Gates, the former chief executive of Microsoft, said in a statement that he was \"truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs's death\". He added: \"The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come.  \"For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honour. I will miss Steve immensely.\"  He is survived by his wife, Laurene, and four children. In a statement his family said Jobs \"died peacefully today surrounded by his family \u2026 We know many of you will mourn with us, and we ask that you respect our privacy during our time of grief\".  Jobs was one of the pioneers of Silicon Valley and helped establish the region's claim as the global centre of technology. He founded Apple with his childhood friend Steve Wozniak, and the two marketed what was considered the world's first personal computer, the Apple II.  He was ousted in a bitter boardroom battle in 1985, a move that he later claimed was the best thing that could have happened to him. Jobs went on to buy Pixar, the company behind some of the biggest animated hits in cinema history including Toy Story, Cars and Finding Nemo.  He returned to Apple 11 years later when it was being written off by rivals. What followed was one of the most remarkable comebacks in business history.  Apple was briefly the most valuable company in the world earlier this year, knocking oil giant Exxon Mobil off the top spot. The company produces $65.2bn a year in revenue compared with $7.1bn in its business year ending September 1997.  Starting with his brightly coloured iMacs, Jobs went on to launch hit after hit transformed personal computing.  Then came the success of the iPod , which revolutionised the music industry, leading to a collapse in CD sales and making Jobs one of the most powerful voices in an industry he loved.  His firm was named in homage to the Beatles' record label, Apple. But the borrowing was permitted on the basis that the computing firm would stay out of music. After the success of the iPod the two Apples became engaged in a lengthy legal battle which finally ended last year when the Beatles allowed iTunes to start selling their back catalogue.  Jobs's remarkable capacity to spot what people wanted next came without the aid of market research or focus groups.  \"For something this complicated, it's really hard to design products by focus groups,\" he once said. \"A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.\"  Jobs initially hid his illness but his startling | Question: What is the name of the co-founder of Apple Computers who died in October 2011?", "truth": ["steve jobs", "steve"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4953", "mistake": "Steve Jobs", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

{"input": "Context: Propulsion - What is an ion? - Northwestern UniversityWhat is an ion?  How does solar electric propulsion        (ion propulsion) work?  What is an ion?  An ion is a charged atom or molecule. It is charged because the number of electrons    do not equal the number of protons in the atom or molecule. An atom can acquire    a positive charge or a negative charge depending on whether the number of electrons    in an atom is greater or less then the number of protons in the atom.  When an atom is attracted to another atom because it has an unequal number    of electrons and protons, the atom is called an ION. If the atom has more electrons    than protons, it is a negative ion, or ANION. If it has more protons than electrons,it    is a positive ion.  What are positively charged ions called? | Reference.comWhat are positively charged ions called? | Reference.com  What are positively charged ions called?  A:  Quick Answer  Positively charged ions are called cations. Ions with positive charges have donated the electrons in their outermost shells to electronegative atoms that tend to attract electrons.  Full Answer  Cations have a positive charge because they are electron donors. These atoms have few electrons in their outermost shell and don't hold on to them well. Atoms have a tendency to fill their outermost shells with the goal of having the full complement of eight electrons in these shells: This is the most stable electron arrangement. To get this stable arrangement, certain atoms give away electrons and some collect them. When an atom loses electrons, the number of protons in the nucleus no longer balances the number of electrons. The net charge on the atom is now positive, and the atom becomes a cation.  ion: Positive and Negative Electric Charges - Infopleaseion: Positive and Negative Electric Charges  ion  Positive and Negative Electric Charges  A neutral atom or group of atoms becomes an ion by gaining or losing one or more electrons or protons. Since the electron and proton have equal but opposite unit charges, the charge of an ion is always expressed as a whole number of unit charges and is either positive or negative. A simple ion consists of only one charged atom; a complex ion consists of an aggregate of atoms with a net charge. If an atom or group loses electrons or gains protons, it will have a net positive charge and is called a cation . If an atom or group gains electrons or loses protons, it will have a net negative charge and is called an anion .  Since ordinary matter is electrically neutral, ions normally exist as groups of cations and anions such that the sum total of positive and negative charges is zero. In common table salt, or sodium chloride, NaCl, the sodium cations, Na+, are neutralized by chlorine anions, Cl - . In the salt sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, two sodium cations are needed to neutralize each carbonate anion, CO3 - 2, because its charge is twice that of the sodium ion.  Sections in this article:  What are negatively charged ions called? | Reference.comWhat are negatively charged ions called? | Reference.com  What are negatively charged ions called?  A:  Quick Answer  Negatively charged ions are called anions. Atoms that are high on the electronegativity scale, such as fluorine and oxygen, become anions by gaining electrons. Highly electronegative atoms strongly attract electrons, thus attaining eight electrons in their outer energy levels and creating a more stable atom.  Full Answer  Atoms in their natural states are neutral, meaning they have the same numbers of protons and electrons. Protons have a positive charge, and electrons have a negative charge. In a neutral atom, the number of negative charges in the energy levels balances the number of positive charges in the nucleus.  The octet rule governs the activity of atoms. Atoms can become more stable by achieving full outer energy levels like the elements called the noble gases. Atoms that have close to eight electrons in their outer energy levels tend to gain electrons rather than lose them.

{"input": "Context: The Kinks - - Classic Rock Bands - classicbands.comThe Kinks  The Kinks  The Kinks were part of the British Invasion, and their early hits, \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\" paved the way for the power chords of the next decade's hard rock. But most of leader Ray Davies' songs have been chronicles of the beleaguered British middle class, scenarios for rock theater, and tales of show-business survival. After their first burst of popularity, the Kinks became a cult band in the mid-Seventies until, buoyed by the new wave's rediscovery of the Davies catalogue, they returned to the spotlight in the Eighties.  Ray Davies was attending art school in England when he joined his younger brother Dave's band, the Ravens, in 1963. In short order Ray had taken over the group -- renamed the Kinks -- retaining bassist Pete Quaife and recruiting Mick Avory to play drums. With this lineup they secured a contract with Pye Records in 1964 and released a rendition of Little Richard's \"Long Tall Sally\", which failed to chart. A second effort, \"You Do Something to Me\" met a similar fate. The band's third release would alter their fortunes as \"You Really Got Me\" went to #1 in England and #7 in the U.S. The following year \"All Day and All of the Night\" and \"Tired of Waiting for You\" both reached the Top Ten in the U.S. and set a pattern for future releases of alternating tough rockers (\"Who'll Be the Next in Line\") and ballads (\"Set Me Free\").  In 1966 the Kinks released two singles of pointed satire, \"A Well Respected Man\" and \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\", indicating the personal turn Ray Davies' songs were taking. Their next album, The Kinks Kontroversy, though containing another hard-rock 45, \"Till the End of the Day,\" was increasingly introspective, with songs like \"I'm on an Island\". Also that year, an appearance on the American TV show Hullabaloo resulted in a problem with the American Federation of Musicians that wasn't resolved until 1969 and prevented the group from touring the U.S. for some time. \"Sunny Afternoon\" (#14, 1966) from the \"Face to Face\" LP was their last hit of that period.  During their years of U.S. exile, Ray Davies became increasingly introspective; he later composed the first of many concept albums, \"The Village Green Preservation Society\" (1969), an LP of nostalgia for all the quaint English customs (such as virginity) that other bands were rebelling against. Dave Davies, who had been writing the occasional song for the Kinks almost from the beginning, had a solo hit in England with \"Death of a Clown,\" actually a Kinks' song that he wrote and sang. More of Dave's singles followed (\"Susannah's Still Alive,\" and \"Lincoln County\"), none of which repeated the success of \"Clown.\" A planned solo album was recorded, but released in drips and drabs years later on collections. The Kinks' next LP, \"Arthur, or The Decline and Fall of the British Empire\", was, along with the Who's \"Tommy\", an early rock opera, written for a British TV show that never aired. The Kinks' next concept album, \"Lola Versus Powerman\" and \"The Moneygoround, Part One\" (#35, 1970), was built around the story of trying to get a hit record. \"Lola,\" was undoubtedly the first rock hit about a transvestite, and reached #9.  The group then left Reprise for RCA, continuing to work on concept pieces, once again without hits. Nevertheless it acquired a reputation as a cheerfully boozy live band. Kinks'  performances were known for messy musicianship and on stage arguments between Ray and Dave Davies, while Ray sometimes sprayed beer at the audience. This was chronicled on \"Everybody's in Show-Biz\", a double album split between Ray Davies' first | Question: \"Which group had hits with \"\"You Really Got Me\"\", \"\"All Day And All Of The Night\"\", \"\"Waterloo Sunset\"\" and \"\"Lola\"\"?\" ?", "truth": ["kinks"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2791", "mistake": "The Kinks", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Published on Apr 16, 2015  Bob the Builder is the animated adventures of Bob and his machines. Working together to overcome various challenges they get the job done.  Looking for Chuggington? https://youtu.be/whYwM7X5cUM  Bob the Builder is a British children's animated television show created by Keith Chapman. In the original series Bob appears as a building contractor specializing in masonry in a stop motion animated programme with his colleague Wendy, various neighbours and friends, and their gang of anthropomorphised work-vehicles and equipment, all made of clay. The show is broadcast in many countries, but originates from the United Kingdom where Bob is voiced by English actor Neil Morrissey. The show was later created using CGI animation starting with the spin-off series Ready, Steady, Build!.  In each episode, Bob and his group help with renovations, construction, and repairs and with other projects as needed. The show emphasizes conflict resolution, co-operation, socialization and various learning skills. Bob's catchphrase is Can we fix it?, to which the other characters respond with Yes we can! This phrase is also the title of the show's theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK.  In October 2014, Bob the Builder was revamped by Mattel for a new series to be aired on Channel 5's Milkshake! in 2015. Amongst the changes were a complete overhaul of the cast, with Harry Potter actor Lee Ingleby replacing Neil Morrissey as the voice of Bob, and Joanne Froggatt and Blake Harrison were also confirmed as the voices of Wendy and Scoop respectively. The setting was also changed, with Bob moving to the bustling metropolis of Spring City.

Spongebob Narcissistic Pants!: Are Cartoons Becoming Narcissistic?  ldoliver Leave a comment  \u201cNo! How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much!\u201d cried SpongeBob. On the day of the 15th, SpongeBob felt confident in himself of becoming the employee of the month for his job at the Krusty\u00a0Krab. He explained to Squidward, who was annoyed by him,\u00a0that he himself works harder\u00a0and that Mr. Krabs would only give the employee of the month award to him. However, Mr. Krabs over heard their conversation and warned SpongeBob that Squidward could possibly win the next award. That\u2019s how SpongeBob panicked. You may think that the cartoon show, SpongeBob Sqaurepants is just a silly, innocent children show, but could there be something that we are not observing carefully that could possibly affect our children psychological? Perhaps, yes. In the show of SpongeBob Squarepants, SpongeBob may be a little narcissistic at times when it comes to work and being the employee of the month. In addition, Squidward is also a narcissistic squid at times when it comes to talent shows or having to be good looking. Therefore, this show contains a little bit of narcissism within it, but just one more question\u2026.has cartoons always been this way? Let\u2019s take a look back at cartoons from the 1970s and compare it with today\u2019s children\u2019s cartoons.  Ok, the first thing that we are going to observe is the cartoons from the 1970s, like Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, The Flintstones, and the Looney Tunes. In the show, Scooby-Doo, there is no sign of narcissism within any of the episodes they show. The main focus of the gang is to solve mysteries, meaning they do not focus on themselves, but more of the safety of others. Also, in the show of The Flintstones, is also no sign of narcissism, or narcissistic characters in any show. The Flintstones were only two goofy, cavemen families and only did silly things and they also thought of other people as well. Now, in the show of Looney Tunes, there is only one particular character who shows a narcissistic personality, which is the skunk, Pepe Le Pew. Pepe is a narcissistic because he shows the lack of empathy, grandiosity, and having the need to be admired by a female cat. However, the cat does not like him and tries to hide from him. She clearly shows him that she isn\u2019t interested, but Pepe like always, is persistent and doesn\u2019t care how she feels towards him. Yet, the cartoons from the 70s hardly shows any narcissism or narcissistic characters in them.  Now that we\u2019ve learned that the 70\u2019s children\u2019s cartoons doesn\u2019t contain narcissism in it, onward to today\u2019s children\u2019s cartoons! Today\u2019s cartoons shows several different cartoons for kids, however will look at Teen Titans GO!, The Amazing World of Gumball, and of course, SpongeBob Squarepants. In the show of Teen Titans GO! Robin shows major\u00a0characteristics of a narcissistic character. In an episode of Robin Backwards, Robin shows the need for admiration of his good looks, talent, and how athletic he is. Within the show, he pulls up a book on a page where it says, \u201cRule 75: Robin is the handsome one!\u201d This obviously shows that Robin lacks empathy for how others would feel about him, he craves for admiration by his teammates, and thinks he is better than everyone else (grandiosity).  Another show that also shows a narcissistic person would be The Amazing World of Gumball because in almost every show, Gumball would think he is better than his best friend, Darwin and he craves for admiration of his, so called, good looks. In an episode of Picture Day, Gumball worries of how he looks and asks Darwin to fix up his face, but Darwin ends up doing like | Question: In children's cartoons, which character lives in a pineapple under the sea?", "truth": ["spongebob", "spongebob squarepants", "squarepants"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4477", "mistake": "SpongeBob Squarepants", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Markus Bernet  Kor\u010dula city, Kor\u010dula island, Croatia.  \u00a9 swisshippo/Fotolia  The first recorded inhabitants of Dalmatia were Illyrians (the name Dalmatia probably comes from the name of an Illyrian tribe, the Delmata, an Indo-European people who overran the northwestern part of the Balkan Peninsula beginning about 1000 bce). The Greeks began to settle there from the 4th century, founding a number of colonies on the islands, the most famous of which were Issa (Vis), Pharos (Hvar), and Corcyra Melaina (Kor\u010dula), and a few towns on the mainland coast, one of which is Salona (Solin), near modern Split. The Greeks, opposed by the Illyrians, appealed to the Romans for help, and a long series of Roman-Illyrian wars began in 229. The fall of the Dalmatian capital, Delminium, in 155 brought Roman civilization to the country. On the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Dalmatia fell under the power of Odoacer in 481 ce and later under that of Theodoric, to become a battlefield during the wars between the Goths and the Byzantine emperor Justinian I .  Split, Croatia.  Palestine  By the time permanent Venetian rule had been established (1420), Dalmatia had passed through about 30 changes of sovereignty . Byzantines , Greeks, Magyars, Tatars, Croatian and Serbian princes, Venetians, Sicilians, and Normans were among its conquerors. The Croatian kings and the Venetian doges were the only rulers who held power long enough to leave a permanent mark on Dalmatian character and consciousness .  Venetian rule , established in 1420 when the king of Croatia, Ladislas of Naples, ceded the country to the Venetian republic, ended in 1797. This period was marked by Venetian warfare against the Turks. When the French gave Venice to Austria under the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797), Dalmatia became Austrian also; but in 1805, under the Treaty of Pressburg , Austria had to cede Dalmatia to Napoleon. It was returned to Austria after Napoleon\u2019s fall and remained an Austrian crownland until 1918.  During World War I , by the secret Treaty of London (1915), the Allies had promised large territories, including northern Dalmatia, to the Italians in return for their support. This treaty embittered negotiations for a peace settlement. Finally, the Treaty of Rapallo (November 12, 1920) between Italy and Yugoslavia gave all Dalmatia to the Yugoslavs except the mainland Zadar (Italian: Zara) enclave and the coastal islands of Cres, Lo\u0161inj (Lussino), and Lastovo. The Palagruza islands, in the mid-Adriatic, also passed to Italy.

Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology .

Novelist and amateur historian Peter Burke wants to test his theory that the king recovered and lived for 40 years after the battle on 14 October 1066.  He is challenging historical records which state that King Harold was killed by William the Conqueror's soldiers.  Battle Historical Society said the theory was unlikely to be true.  Death bed declaration  Mr Burke is sponsoring a search for the remains of King Harold, widely believed to be buried in the grounds of Waltham Abbey.  He said the alternative version of Harold's death comes from a 12th Century document, Vita Harold, in the British Library which he found while researching his trilogy The Promise.  \"It was taken from a young novice priest who took the last rites of an old pilgrim called Christian who declared on his death bed that he was Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon king,\" said Mr Burke.  \"He was hidden in Winchester and brought back to health by a Moorish nurse. He tried to raise an army in Germany but they weren't interested and he spent his life travelling as a pilgrim.\"  Image copyright Hulton archive/Getty Images  Image caption The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings and the death of King Harold  The scan, taking place on the 948th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, is being carried out by the geological survey company which helped to locate the remains of King Richard III in 2012 beneath a car park in Leicester.  Neil Clephane-Cameron, from Battle and District Historical Society, said the story that King Harold survived the battle did not sit comfortably with him.  \"The contemporary accounts, both Norman and Saxon, all give the fact that Harold was killed at the battle,\" he said.  \"Even if there is a body at Waltham it doesn't mean that he necessarily survived but it might confirm whether the accounts are correct because there should be be fairly distinctive giveaways.\"  In which battle did Harold II, the last Saxon king of England,In which battle did Harold II, the last Saxon king of England, lose his life?

Both ships featured technology thought to have been developed historically much later.

Read on Owl Eyes  This eText is now on Owl Eyes. Clicking this link will open a new window.  Duke Orsino of Illyria, presiding over the merry, mixed-up world of Twelfth Night, opens the play with these festive sentiments, soured though they be by the affected airs of the melancholic lover. He has convinced himself that he's insanely in love with a wealthy and resistant lady, who is in mourning for her brother and only annoyed by Orsino's inappropriate attentions. The duke's idea of a cure for his disease is to stuff himself sick with his own passions.  Orsino's brand of self-indulgent pouting comes in for much ribbing here and elsewhere in Shakespeare, most vividly in As You Like It and Much Ado about Nothing. For melancholic poseurs like Orsino, who are actually expected to make spectacles of themselves, affecting gestures are more important than sincere emotions.

(See Important Quotations Explained )  In the land of Illyria, Duke Orsino enters, attended by his lords. Orsino is hopelessly in love with the beautiful Lady Olivia and pines away for her. He refuses to hunt and orders musicians to entertain him while he thinks about his desire for Olivia. His servant Valentine reminds him that Olivia does not return his love or even listen to the messages he sends her. We learn from Valentine that Olivia is in mourning for her brother, who has recently died. She wears a dark veil, and she has vowed that no one will see her face for another seven years\u2014and she refuses to marry anyone until then. Orsino, obsessed with the woman who keeps refusing him, wants only to lie around on beds of flowers, listening to sweet music and dreaming of Olivia.  Summary: Act I, scene ii  Meanwhile, on the Illyrian sea coast, a young noblewoman named Viola speaks with the captain whose crew has just rescued her from a shipwreck. Although Viola was found and rescued, her brother, Sebastian, seems to have vanished in the storm. The captain tells Viola that Sebastian may still be alive. He says that he saw Sebastian trying to keep afloat by tying himself to a broken mast. But Viola does not know whether or not it is worth holding onto hope. In the meantime, however, she needs to find a way to support herself in this strange land.  The ship\u2019s captain tells Viola all about Duke Orsino, who rules Illyria. Viola remarks that she has heard of this duke and mentions that he used to be a bachelor. The captain says that Orsino still is a bachelor, but then goes on to tell Viola about the Lady Olivia, whom the duke is courting. Again, we hear the tale of how Lady Olivia\u2019s brother died, leading her to cut herself off from the world. Viola expresses a wish that she could become a servant in the house of Olivia and hide herself away from the world as well. The captain responds that it is unlikely that Viola will enter Olivia\u2019s service because Olivia refuses to see any visitors, the duke included. Viola decides that, in that case, she will disguise herself as a young man and seek service with Duke Orsino instead. When she promises to pay him well, the captain agrees to help her, and they go off together in order to find a disguise for her. | Question: Subtitled \u2018What You Will\u2019, which play begins: \u2018If music be the food of love, play on\u2019?", "truth": ["twelfth night"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1599", "mistake": "Twelfth Night", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Context: What is the perfect score in ten-pin bowling? | Reference.comWhat is the perfect score in ten-pin bowling? | Reference.com  What is the perfect score in ten-pin bowling?  A:  Quick Answer  The perfect score in a game of ten-pin bowling is 300. A typical session in a bowling league consists of three games, so the perfect three game series score is 900. To score 300 in a game, a player needs to score twelve consecutive strikes, which includes the standard frames, plus the two extra throws on frame ten.  Full Answer  Though previously a rare accomplishment, many more people now achieve a perfect game score than before. For example, in 1952, only 198 people scored 300 in a game, according to the American Bowling Congress. By 2001, that number had increased to over 42,000. It is believed better bowling conditions and improved technology led to the upsurge.  A three-game series with a score of 900 is still much rarer. According to the USBC, there are only 24 certified three-game series 900 scores in the history of the sport. The first 900 score did not happen until 1997, achieved by a Nebraska bowler named Jeremy Sonnenfeld.  How To Keep Score For A Game Of Bowling - HomesteadHow To Keep Score For A Game Of Bowling  The Basics of Keeping Score  \u00a0 \u00a0 Even with automatic scoring, it's a good idea to know the fundamentals of keeping score in the sport of bowling.\u00a0 After all, you have to know how to keep score if you want to know what you need to bowl to beat your opponent for either competition or just for fun!!  \u00a0 \u00a0 First, what is a game of bowling?\u00a0 Some people get confused when they hear the phrases \"per game\" or \"per game per person.\"\u00a0 A game of bowling consists of 10 frames, in which a bowler has two chances per frame to knock down all ten pins.\u00a0 If a bowler knocks down all ten pins in those two turns in the 10th frame, an extra bonus chance is awarded.  \u00a0 \u00a0 So, when we say \"per game\" or \"per game per person,\" that means each 10 full frames bowled by each person.\u00a0 So if two people bowl one game each (10 frames each) they have bowled a total of two games.\u00a0 Our Automatic Scorers can fit six people on each lane, so if each person bowls a game, six complete games have been bowled.\u00a0 Even though each person has bowled only one game, 60 total frames have been bowled by the group, equaling 6 games.  This is an example of one complete game:  Scoring  \u00a0 \u00a0 There are several symbols used when keeping score: an \"X\" signifies a \"strike\" in which all ten pins have been knocked down by the first roll of the ball in a frame; a \"/\" signifies a \"spare\" in which the remainder of the pins left standing after the first roll are knocked down on the second roll in a frame; a \"-\" indicates that no pins were knocked down on that roll, called a \"miss\"; an\"F\" indicates a \"foul\" where a part of the bowler's body went past the foul line, which marks the boundry of the approach (the part of the lane where we walk and release the ball) and the lane itself, where the oil is placed and the ball rolls towards the pins; and a \"O\" around a number indicates that the pins left standing after the first roll are in a formation known as a \"split.\"\u00a0 Some scorers, such as ours, use an \"S\" in front of the number to indicate a split.\u00a0 Splits occur when the headpin (the foremost pin) is knocked down, and there is a gap of at least one pin between all the others left standing.\u00a0 The terms \"wide\" and \"washout\" are used to define this situation except that the headpin was left standing.\u00a0 Sometimes, a \"W\" is used to indicate | Question: What is the perfect score in ten pin bowling?", "truth": ["300"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4338", "mistake": "300", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

{"input": "Context: Ottorino Respighi | ArkivMusicOttorino Respighi | ArkivMusic  Ottorino Respighi  Biography  Born: Jul 9, 1879; Italy\u00a0\u00a0 Died: Apr 18, 1936; Italy\u00a0\u00a0 Period: Romantic  Mostly known for his richly descriptive symphonic poems Fontane di Roma (The Fountains of Rome) and Pini di Roma (The Pines of Rome), Respighi was a versatile composer who translated into music powerful visual experiences and feelings of deep attachment to cherished places. Respighi's symphonic works are praised primarily for their exquisite orchestration, but these compositions also possess a charm which transcends the merely picturesque. This Read more charm is particularly evident in works inspired by Medieval and Renaissance music, such as Ancient Airs and Dances for orchestra.  Born in 1879, Respighi studied from 1891 to 1900 at the Liceo Musicale in Bologna. In 1900 and 1902, he traveled to Russia, where he played the viola in the Imperial Orchestra in St. Petersburg. During his two extended visits to Russia, Respighi studied with Rimsky-Korsakov, absorbing the Russian master's ideas regarding orchestral color. In 1903, Respighi turned to a career of a concert violinist; he also played chamber music, joining Bologna's Mugellini Quartet as a violist. During the early 1900s, Respighi started writing music, but his compositions (chamber and orchestral works) attracted little attention. In 1908-1909, he was in Berlin, where he immersed himself in German musical culture. In 1913, Respighi settled in Rome, accepting a composition professorship at the Liceo (subsequently Conservatorio) di Santa Cecilia. Enchanted by Rome, Respighi found inspiration in the city's unique atmosphere and consequently formulated an original, personal musical language, exemplified by Fontane di Roma (Fountains of Rome), written in 1914-1916.  Respighi's next project was a children's opera, La bella dormente nel bosco (Sleeping Beauty), finished in 1921, and regarded as his best stage work. After the Fontane di Roma, Respighi sought inspiration in early music, introducing Renaissance and Medieval themes into his compositions. In 1917, he composed the first set of his Antiche arie e danze per liuto (&Ancient Airs and Dances for Lute), for piano duet and strings. The second and third sets, for strings, were composed in 1923 and 1931, respectively. Sometimes regarded as adaptations, these compositions nevertheless exude a unique freshness and sincerity.  Works composed in the 1920s reflected both Respighi's fascination with early music and his desire to translate visual sensations into music. Thus, the Concerto gregoriano for violin and orchestra, composed in 1921, and Quartetto dorico, written in 1924, evoke the spirit of ancient music, while The Pines of Rome describes the splendor of the Roman landscape.  In 1924, Respighi was named director of the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia, resigning, however, two years later, so he would have more time to compose. Nevertheless, this period included two American tours, in 1925-1926 and 1932, as a conductor and pianist. He also accompanied singers, including his wife, Elsa Olivieri-Sangiacomo, who was also a composer. Works composed during this period include Vetrate di chiesa (Church Windows), for orchestra, written in 1925, and the Trittico botticelliano (Three Botticelli Pictures), composed in 1927 -- a work inspired by three paintings by the great Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli. Composed in 1928-1930, Respighi's Lauda per la Nativita del Signore, for two pianos, wind ensembles, vocal soloists, and chorus, develops Renaissance motifs to create a charming, serene celebration of the spirit of Christmas. Elected to the Royal Academy of Italy in 1932, Respighi died in 1936. Read less  There are 390 Ottorino Respighi recordings available.

{"input": "Context: Thomas Aquinas, Theologian and Philosopher - Timeline IndexThomas Aquinas, Theologian and Philosopher - Timeline Index  Timeline Index  Thomas Aquinas, Theologian and Philosopher  Thomas Aquinas was an Italian Dominican priest of the Catholic Church, and an immensely influential philosopher and theologian in the tradition of scholasticism, known as Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Communis, or Doctor Universalis. He was the foremost classical proponent of natural theology, and the father of Thomism. His influence on Western thought is considerable, and much of modern philosophy was conceived as a reaction against, or as an agreement with his ideas, particularly in the areas of ethics, natural law and political theory.  Thomas is held in the Catholic Church to be the model teacher for those studying for the priesthood. The works for which he is best-known are the Summa Theologica and the Summa Contra Gentiles. One of the 33 Doctors of the Church, he is considered the Church's greatest theologian and philosopher. Pope Benedict XV declared: \"The Church has declared Thomas' doctrines to be her own.\"  More on this Website  Doctor Angelicus | Article about Doctor Angelicus by The ...Doctor Angelicus | Article about Doctor Angelicus by The Free Dictionary  Doctor Angelicus | Article about Doctor Angelicus by The Free Dictionary  http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Doctor+Angelicus  Related to Doctor Angelicus: Angelic Doctor , St. Thomas Aquinas  Aquinas, Thomas  \u00a0  Born 1225 or 1226, in the castle of Roccasecca, near Aquino, southern Italy; died Mar. 7, 1274, in the monastery of Fossanuova, southern Italy. Medieval philosopher and theologian. Known for his formulation of orthodox Scholasticism as a system. Founder of Thomism.  Thomas attended the University of Naples from 1239 to 1244 and became a Dominican monk in 1244; he then studied under Albertus Magnus at the University of Paris from 1245 to 1248 and at the University of Cologne from 1248 to 1252. In 1257 he became a doctor of the University of Paris. He lectured at Paris, Cologne, Rome, and Naples. Thomas was made a saint of the Catholic Church in 1323, and in 1567 he was recognized as the fifth doctor of the church.  In his principal works\u2014the monumental Summa theologiae (consisting of close to 3,000 articles and left uncompleted) and Summa contra gentiles\u2014Thomas presented a summary of the rationalist theological thinking of High Scholasticism, which attempted to clothe the doctrines of faith in the vestments of common sense. Following in the footsteps of Albertus Magnus, Thomas went back to Aristotle as a source for his concepts\u2014namely, Aristotle\u2019s \u201ccommon sensibles\u201d and the idea of a system of \u201cnatural\u201d reason as the underpinning of \u201csupernatural\u201d dogma.  The task that Thomas set for himself was to create a systematic order of the many within the one, rather than to contemplate the one in isolation from the many; he sought, as it were, to deduce the existence of god from the existence of things. In this respect, Thomas\u2019 thinking is in contrast to the abstract speculation of early Scholasticism (as exemplified by Anselm of Canterbury)\u2014a school of thought that was in line with Plato, Neoplatonism, and Augustine. Under the rubrics of the Summa theologiae, the same schemes of thought are imposed on an infinite variety of specific questions, ranging from the five proofs of the existence of god to a definition of the limits of what is or is not permissible in the conduct of financial affairs.  Thomas Aquinas\u2019 ontology, which can be traced back to Aristotle, is based on the antithesis of what is potential, or possible, and what is actual, or real. The potential is that which is uncompleted, unfixed, subject to changes and variations, and thus imperfect. Matter\u2014the weakest form of existence\u2014represents pure potentiality, being only a passive receptacle that is acted upon.

Pronghorns are known for their large migration patterns, which are the longest land migration (over 150 miles each way) in the continental United States. They are also the fastest land animal in all of North America with top speeds reaching nearly 60 miles an hour. While they cannot run as fast as the cheetah, they can maintain their speeds for a greater duration. Pronghorns have excellent eyesight and can spot predators from quite a distance. Unfortunately, the traditional migratory routes of the pronghorn have been disrupted by the greatly increased expansion of natural gas drilling.

{"input": "Context: Kodak: From Brownie and roll film to digital disaster ...Kodak: From Brownie and roll film to digital disaster - BBC News  BBC News  Kodak: From Brownie and roll film to digital disaster  By James Cowling Business reporter, BBC News  20 January 2012  In pictures: Kodak's development  The name Kodak has been synonymous with the world of cameras since the firm was founded by George Eastman in the 19th Century.  His vision to keep Kodak at the forefront of photography by the masses has seen its peaks and troughs.  George Eastman saw Kodak take off after pioneering roll film in 1886  - an alternative to cumbersome photographic plates normally only developed by chemists and specialists.  The opaque backing paper allowed roll film to be loaded in daylight. It is typically printed with frame number markings which can be viewed through a small red window at the rear of the camera.  It allowed people to carry around films without their exposure to daylight affecting their use.  $1 camera  Image caption Roll film was a major invention for Kodak  As roll film took off, the first model of the Kodak camera appeared. It took round pictures 2.5in (6.35cm) in diameter and carried a roll of film enough for 100 exposures.  Its invention almost single-handedly bought photography to the masses, as before that time both apparatus and processes were too burdensome to classify photography as recreation.  By 1900, Kodak hit the mass market with a new, cheaper camera. Priced at $1, it was intended to be a camera that anyone could afford and use, leading to the popular slogan: \"You push the button, we do the rest.\"  An estimated 25 million Brownie versions were sold up until the 1940s.  By 1935, Kodak had invented the first mass-produced colour roll film for cameras, known as Kodachrome. It was initially offered in 16mm format for motion pictures; 35mm slides and 8mm home movies followed in 1936.  Cornered market  Your Kodak moments  As with the Brownie, Kodak cornered the mass market again in the 1960s with the Instamatic. Using the new cartridge film which dropped into the camera without the need to attach to a reel, it was a huge hit. More than 50 million Instamatic cameras were produced between 1963 and 1970.  The cornering of the home photography market by Kodak was reflected in the figures; in 1976, the company sold 90% of the photographic film in the US along with 85% of the cameras.  Although competitors such as AGFA and Nikon have been rivals of Kodak for generations, it was Fuji who gave the firm the biggest headache.  In 1984, Kodak turned down the chance to be the official film for the Los Angeles Olympics, an offer Fuji snapped up without hesitation.  Fuji then took a large piece of the non-digital market in the mid 1990s, when it invented the single-use film camera.  In 1975, Kodak engineer Steven Sasson created what the company describes as the first digital camera, a toaster-size prototype capturing black-and-white images at a resolution of 0.1 megapixels.  Although the technology did not catch on immediately, analysts felt the company's failure to capitalise on this was the start of its decline.  Overtaken by rivals  Former Kodak vice president Don Strickland claims he left the company in 1993 after he failed to get backing from within the company to release a digital camera.  Image caption The switch to digital undermined Kodak's reliance on conventional film sales  He said: \"We developed the world's first consumer digital camera but we could not get approval to launch or sell it because of fear of the effects on the film market... a huge opportunity missed.\"  Through the 1990s, Kodak spent $4bn on developing the photo technology inside most mobile phones and digital devices.  But a reluctance to ease its heavy reliance on film allowed rivals like Canon and Sony to rush into the fast-emerging digital arena.  The immensely lucrative analogue business Kodak worried about undermining too soon was virtually erased in a decade by the filmless photography | Question: Who helped bring photography to the masses with his Kodak roll-film technology?", "truth": ["george eastman"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1637", "mistake": "George Eastman", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

{"input": "Context: Going for GoldGoing for Gold is a British television game show that originally aired on BBC1 between 12 October 1987 and 9 July 1996. It has since been revived for Channel 5 from 13 October 2008 to 20 March 2009.  Background  1987-96  Going for Gold was originally broadcast on BBC1 from 12 October 1987 to 9 July 1996, usually, after the lunchtime broadcast of Australian soap opera Neighbours. It was presented by Irish broadcaster Henry Kelly, and its defining concept was that it featured contestants from different European countries who competed against each other to answer questions (all in English) to win a prize. The show was shown on BBC1 in the UK and on Super Channel (later NBC Super Channel) in Continental Europe and on BBC TV Europe (which carried a mix of BBC1 and BBC2 output up to its dissolution in early 1991).  The 1987\u20131996 run of the quiz show each week had seven contestants that spoke English (each representing a different European country) who would compete against each other for a place in the finals. The show followed a repechage format (now common, but then, unusual), whereby unsuccessful contestants from Monday's show would return on Tuesday, and so on throughout the week. Each episode lasted for 25 minutes, including four rounds.  There were ten series in total (two in 1992). The first five series were broadcast during the winter, and many of these were split in half by the Christmas break. The (second) 1992 and 1993 series went out in the autumn, the last three were broadcast during the summer. The 1996 series featured competitors from the United Kingdom only.  2008-09  The show was revived and produced by talkbackTHAMES and aired on Channel 5, premiering from 13 October to 19 December 2008. The new version featured only contestants from the UK and Ireland, was broadcast live and hosted by newsreader John Suchet. Former ITV Play host Alex Kramer, did the newly introduced viewers' phone-in question section from 17 November 2008 until 20 March 2009, repeating the questions several times and talking to the selected phone-in contestant. The set questions involve many clues to an item or person, and the phone-ins were notorious for taking up significant amounts of time during the show.   The show continued its run between 5 January and 20 March 2009. Vicky Letch temporarily replaced Alex Kramer as the viewer's phone-in host whilst Alex was on holiday. When John Suchet was unavailable, the programme was hosted by Dean Wilson. At the end of the series, the sixteen winners with the most daily wins contested four semi-finals, the winners of which competed in the series final on 20 March 2009, won by Iwan Thomas.  Format  Elimination round (Round 1)  Each edition began with a short general knowledge round to all seven contestants. Out of the contestants who started the show, four would go through to the next round (always referred to as the \"first round proper\" by Kelly). These four would be the first who managed to answer each of the four general knowledge questions correctly. These questions would usually take the form of a 20 to 30-second description of an object, person, animal or place (usually beginning \"Who am I?\", \"What am I?\", etc.), with progressively more details being revealed by Kelly until someone was able to identify it. By the Thursday show, there would be only four contestants left to play the opening round and so several questions were asked and the first person to two points would join the previous days' winners in \"the first round proper\".  This round was not played in the 2008 version.  Beat the Buzzer (Round 2)  The Beat the Buzzer round was a general knowledge round, played with hands on plungers. Questions were worth one, two or three points. A contestant who gave a correct answer would be told the subject of the next question, and got to choose the value of that question.

George Santayana: 1863-1952: Philosopher  The Spanish-born American philosopher George Santayana is popularly known for a single sentence that has entered the stock arsenal of American political rhetoric: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" Santayana wrote in his 1905 book Reason in Common Sense. Students of Santayana's work complain that the maxim has been taken out of context: originally it formed part of a theory about how knowledge is acquired rather than being a moral exhortation to pay attention to history, and it has a didactic quality that is foreign to the subtle, paradoxical, and occasionally humorous quality of Santayana's thought.  Yet Santayana's little sentence forms a good introduction to his work in several respects. It is elegant\u2014Santayana was noted among philosophers as an elegant writer, one who addressed himself to the general educated reader rather than primarily to fellow philosophers. And the sentence embodies an interest in how the human spirit constructs an ordered world\u2014though Santayana was in the philosophical sense a materialist who denied the existence of the soul, he nevertheless believed, in the words of Wilfred McClay writing in the Wilson Quarterly, that although the spirit was a mere byproduct of the natural world, \"the realm of the spirit was all the more to be cherished because it was the only truly human consolation within the vast indifference of nature.\"  Given Traditional American Education  Santayana was born in Madrid, Spain , on December 16, 1863. His father was a Spanish diplomat who had served in the Philippines . Santayana's mother was his father's second wife; she was the widow of an American businessman from Boston, and soon after Santayana was born she moved to Boston because she wanted her children from her first marriage to be educated there. Santayana was brought to Boston by his father in 1872, but the father soon returned to Spain.  Though he arrived in Boston speaking almost no English, Santayana excelled at Boston Latin School, then as now one of the most competitive college preparatory institutions in the United States . In 1882 he enrolled at Harvard, where he notched a brilliant record as a student and became involved in such extracurricular activities as the Harvard Lampoon humor magazine even though he felt a certain detachment from Harvard's Anglo-Saxon-Protestant atmosphere and satirized the school in his autobiographical 1936 novel, The Last Puritan. Santayana studied at Harvard with William James, then considered the dean of American philosophers. After his graduation in 1886, he studied in Germany for two years, but returned to Harvard to pursue a Ph.D. degree, which he finished in 1889.  At a Glance . . .

Career: Harvard University, faculty, 1889-1912; author, 1896-1952.  A slot filling in for the overworked James quickly evolved into a full professorship at Harvard for Santayana, who became part of the school's faculty for 23 years. His students there included several who went on to become famous American writers themselves: poets Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Gertrude Stein, and T.S. Eliot, and political writer Walter Lippmann. Santayana, who never married and whom historians believe to have been an inactive homosexual, still chafed at the atmosphere of repressive New England . \"I wonder if you realize,\" he wrote to James in a letter quoted in the Wilson Quarterly, \"the years of suppressed irritation which I have passed in the midst of an unintelligible, sanctimonious, and often disingenuous Protestantism , which is thoroughly alien and repulsive to me.\" Although an atheist, Santayana maintained a cultural connection to Roman Catholicism.

While serving as head maternity nurse at a Boulder, Colorado hospital, several infants in her care died under mysterious circumstances. She was tried for their deaths, but she acquitted for lack of evidence. But the press \u2014 which called her \"the Dragon Lady\" \u2014 strongly implied that she was in fact guilty. Paul also learns that she killed several patients at other hospitals where she worked, but no one noticed because they were either very sick or suffered debilitating injuries beforehand. Annie also killed her childhood neighbors and their father, her own father, her college roommate, and a hitchhiker she allowed to stay with her \u2014 in total, almost 70 people.

In Misery  In the movie, Paul's car is hurled off the road as a result of a snowstorm, which lands near Annie's private property. The crash has caused a bilateral fracture of Paul's legs and rendered him unconscious. He is rescued by Annie a short time later, and wakes up in her house. She first appears to be a kind, nurturing caregiver, and Paul allows her to read his manuscript in exchange for saving him. Paul claimed he grew tired of writing nothing but Misery novels and desired to create new characters and new stories. When it is revealed that Paul has killed off Misery Chastain, she angrily screams at Sheldon for this. She then forces Paul to burn his\u00a0manuscript and she tells him to write a new one, in which Misery is alive and well. She also gives Paul potent medication that will serve a double effect, numbing the pain whilst keeping his imagination active for writing.  MISERY  hile Paul writes, he tries to escape several times.

To test this theory, he selects Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, and begins to give her elocution lessons. Eliza's transformation into a high society lady is not an easy transition and the experiment produces some unexpected and humorous results.  This is a charming and delightful musical with a superb range of engaging, character-driven tunes. As should be expected with a musical based on a work by Shaw, Fabian Socialist morality is presented and debated within the movie. However, the storyline of the musical subtly refutes the play's anti-morality arguments and comes down on the side of morality in the end. Moreover, with the exception of the repeated use of one minor obscenity and one minor vulgarity, any other offensive elements are only implied, often refuted and never explicitly shown. With its memorable music and wonderful performances, MY FAIR LADY is an enjoyable musical comedy worth revisiting.

NPR, \"chooses to split the difference, using Myanmar on first reference,  along with a reminder that the country is also known as Burma.\"  There's more to the story, of course. And politics play a role in why some nations still use Burma, not Myanmar, when referring to the country.  Article continues after sponsorship  The BBC (which still refers to the country only as Burma) writes that :  \"Burmah, as it was spelt in the 19th Century, is a local corruption of the word  Myanmar. They have both been used within Burma for a long time, says anthropologist  Gustaaf Houtman, who has written extensively about Burmese politics. ... If Burmese people are writing for publication, they use 'Myanmar', but  speaking they use 'Burma', he says. ...  \"Richard Coates, a linguist at the University of Western England, says  adopting the traditional, formal name is an attempt by the junta to break from  the colonial past. 'Local opposition groups do not accept that, and presumably prefer to use the old colloquial name, at least until they have a government with popular  legitimacy,' [Coates says]. 'Governments that agree with this stance still call the country  Burma.' \"  The U.S. is among the nations that choose not to refer to the nation as Myanmar. \"Out of support for the democratic opposition,\" and its victory in a 1990 parliamentary election \u2014 the results of which were annulled by the military rulers \u2014 \"the U.S. Government likewise uses 'Burma,' \" the State Department says .

{"input": "Context: Who was Moses' wife? Did Moses have more than one wife?Who was Moses\u2019 wife? Did Moses have more than one wife?  Who was Moses\u2019 wife? Did Moses have more than one wife?  \u00a0  Subscribe to our Question of the Week :  Question: \"Who was Moses\u2019 wife? Did Moses have more than one wife?\"  Answer: The Bible does not say much about Moses\u2019 wife, Zipporah . We know that she was the daughter of a man called Jethro (or Reuel), who was a priest in the land of Midian (Exodus 3:1; cf. 2:18). The Bible does not explicitly say that Moses had more than one wife. However, Numbers 12:1 leads many to surmise another wife: \u201cMiriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.\u201d The question of the number of Moses\u2019 wives hinges on the identity of this Cushite (or Ethiopian) woman. Is this a reference to Zipporah? Or is this another woman?  First, some background. While he was still in Egypt, Moses killed an Egyptian guard who was assaulting a Hebrew slave, and he hid the body. Soon, Moses got word that Pharaoh knew what he had done and was going to kill him, so he fled from Egypt to the land of Midian to avoid prosecution. When he got to Midian, he sat down by a well, and there he encountered a family living in that area. The priest of Midian had seven daughters, shepherdesses who came to water their father\u2019s flock. Some shepherds tried to drive the women away, but Moses fought the shepherds off and helped the women, even drawing water for their animals. The seven reported this heroic action to their father, and he asked Moses to come and eat with his family. Sometime later, Moses was married to Zipporah, the daughter of Reuel, the priest of Midian (Exodus 2:16\u201322).  In later chapters Reuel is called Jethro. There is no explanation for this name change, but the title \u201cpriest of Midian\u201d accompanies both names, and he is called Moses\u2019 father-in-law, so it is safe to assume this was the same man. The only other possibility is that there were two priests of Midian, one called Jethro and one called Reuel and that Moses had married a daughter from each family\u2014but that would be very unlikely.  More evidence that Moses only had one wife is found in Exodus 4:20: \u201cMoses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt.\u201d Wife is singular, and there is no mention of any other wife or wives that Moses had. On the way to Egypt, Zipporah circumcised their son and thus saved her husband\u2019s life\u2014Moses had neglected to obey the Lord in this matter, and the Lord would have killed Moses had not Zipporah intervened (Exodus 4:24\u201326). After this event, it seems that Moses sent Zipporah and his sons back home to stay with Jethro. We don\u2019t encounter Zipporah again until after the exodus when she returns to Moses in the wilderness (Exodus 18).  That brings us to Numbers 12:1 and the reference to Moses\u2019 marriage to the Cushite, or Ethiopian. It is possible, though not probable, that the Cushite is Zipporah. Arguing against that possibility are two facts: 1) the link between Midianites and Ethiopians is very difficult to trace convincingly; and 2) the objection to the marriage raised by Miriam and Aaron seems to indicate a recent event. Moses and Zipporah would have been married for over 40 years by this time, and it is unlikely that Moses\u2019 siblings would just then be protesting. Much more likely is that Zipporah had died (although her death is not recorded in Scripture) and that Moses had remarried.  Some see in Moses\u2019 marriages to two Gentiles as prefiguring the gospel message going into all the world, blessing even the Gentiles (see Acts 1:8). Zipporah the Midianite was related to the Israelites but only through Abraham\u2019s son by a concubine (Genesis | Question: Who was the wife of Moses?", "truth": ["zipporah"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4372", "mistake": "Zipporah", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

The patriarch of the Munster household, Herman is an entity much like Frankenstein's monster, comparable to Lurch on the show's competitor, The Addams Family.   Origins  In the context of the series, Herman was created in 1815 at the University of Heidelberg by Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Work on him was finally completed around 1850 (neither Lily nor Grandpa is quite sure when) along with his twin brother Charlie. Leaving Germany for Great Britain at a young age, Herman was adopted by the Munsters of Munster Hall, a noble family living in the fictitious Shroudshire, England.  At some point Herman moved to Transylvania (a region in Romania), where he met Lily Dracula. In 1865 (technically at the age of 15, but physically older) Herman married Lily, and eventually the couple and Grandpa (Lily's father) moved to America, where Herman joined the U.S. Army, fighting in World War II.  Family relations  In The Munsters Today, he is given a younger brother named Frank. And in the 1995 movie Here Come the Munsters he is given a sister named Elsa who resembles the Bride of Frankenstein. She is also married to Mr. Hyde, who transforms into Dr. Jekyll.  In the series  Herman is employed by Gateman, Goodbury and Graves, a funeral home in Mockingbird Heights, having started out as a \"box boy.\" Herman's co-workers sometimes remark on his height and strength, but otherwise do not appear to find his appearance and color (green) out of the ordinary. Occasionally, Herman is picked up by \"the company car\" (a hearse), which he climbs into via the back door and rides as if he were a body being delivered.  Description  Herman is a lovable, good-natured, clumsy, buffoon. Despite having been alive for centuries, he behaves rather childishly, often throwing temper tantrums, punctuated with thundering animal-like roaring. Despite his childish behaviors he is a caring father figure to his son Eddie and a loving, devoted husband. He is very kind to everyone, but he is also very naive, often misunderstanding situations or falling for various schemes. He occasionally has problems recognizing when someone has malicious or dishonest intentions towards him. Most people, however, flee in terror on seeing Herman's monstrous visage, which he always attributes to something else. In some instances, his presence has caused inanimate objects or artwork to come to life and flee in terror: such as a statue of Daniel Boone in a park, a stuffed gorilla in a museum, and a graffiti drawing of a face in a jail cell starting out smiling and the facial expression changes to terror.  Herman is incredibly strong, once lifting a solid metal demolition ball casually with one hand. He is almost immovable; a number of times, cars have run into him without causing him injury. A safe fell on his head (\"John Doe Munster\") and gave him amnesia, although it did not hurt him. When asked how much he weighs, Herman says: \"Three spins\", meaning the dial on the scale goes around three times. In the episode \"Herman's Lawsuit\", his driver's license gives his weight as 380 lb, height as , and eyes as brown. (On the other hand, in the episode \"All-Star Munster,\" Herman, when asked his height, states \"seven foot three\" but when asked how tall he is in his stocking feet, he replies, \"Seven foot four - I wear very thick socks.\")  Herman considers himself handsome (as does the rest of his family) even though he can crack a mirror by looking at it, once even cracking a shiny frying pan he looked into. In one episode, Herman is struck by lightning, reverting to a \"hideous\" form (actually Fred Gwynne without any make-up). He tries to hide his appearance from all those around him until two more | Question: Who played the part of 'herman' in the 1960's TV series 'The Munsters'?", "truth": ["fred gwynne"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6284", "mistake": "Fred Gwynne", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Glazer.  Majestic Theatre, New York - 19 April, 1945 (890 perfs)  with John Raitt (Billy) and Jan Clayton (Julie).  Opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, 7 June 1950 with Stephen         Douglass and Iva Withers.  A film version was produced by Twentieth Century-Fox in 1956 with Gordon         MacRae and Shirley Jones.  From the magical evocation of the carousel in the overture to the         majestic and moving strains of the immortal \"You'll Never Walk         Alone\", this giant of the musical stage remains timeless and starbright.         The poignant story of the faithful Julie and her brutish husband Billy         is one of the most powerful books of the musical theatre and perfectly         matches its extraordinary score. Recently revived by the Royal National         Theatre to immense critical acclaim. Famous songs include \"Mister         Snow\", \"If I Loved You\", \"June Is Bustin' Out All         Over\" and \"When The Children Are Asleep\".  Synopsis  Act I  The opening scene is an amusement part on the coast of New England around         the year 1873. A feature of the park is Mrs Mullin's carousel with its         gaily painted horses and its jack-the-lad barker, Billy Bigelow. Mrs.         Mullin likes Billy and she likes the amount of feminine business he brings         to the carousel, but she is clearly jealous of the girls whom he picks         out for his special attention. She gets sourly steamed up when he pays         a little attention to a mill girl called Julie Jordan and she vehemently       warns the surprised Julie aways fromthe carousel.  Her timing is bad, for Billy himself catches the end of the warning.         He turns on his employer and tells her that she has no control over what         girls he sees and, when the quarrel raises itself a tone, Mrs Mullin,         not for the first time, sacks the barker. Julie and her friend Carrie         are aghast at the scene, and even more worried when it turns out that         Billy probably doesn't have the price of a beer to his name, but the         man shrugs off such worries. He's going to get his things and then one         of them can go and have a drink with him. He doesn't mind which.  Carrie is open-mouthed with amazement at Billy, and the girls are quite         fazed at the fact that he is paying attention them. The quiet, introspective         Julie has never had a boyfriend ('You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan')         and Carrie's experience of men is in a very different field. She's going         to marry the respectable and reliable fisherman, `Mister Snow'. When         Billy returns and asks which one of them is going to spend the evening         with him, Julie volunteers without hesitation. She faces dismissal from         the mill for doing so, for Mr Bascombe, the mill owner, insists that         his girls are in their dormitory on time and when the two of them are         seen together by Bascombe and a policeman, her fate is settled. She is         as much out of a job as Billy is.  Although she is warned of Billy's reputation as a layabout, a sponger         and a ladies' man, Julie declares firmly that she will spend the evening         with him. She's a strange one: nothing like any of the women Billy has         known before. She says she isn't ever going to marry and when he asks         her, teasing, if she would marry him, the layabout and sponger, Julie         has only one simple response-'If I Loved You'. At the end of the evening         they kiss, and the kiss is not the usual kiss Billy gets from his women.

{"input": "Context: Classical Notes - Classical Classics - Puccini: Turandot ...Classical Notes - Classical Classics - Puccini: Turandot, By Peter Gutmann  In this article on Giacomo Puccini's final opera Turandot, we explore the fable on which it is based, the opera itself, Puccini's futile struggle to complete it, others' efforts at completion , the premiere , some historically significant early recordings and some acclaimed recordings .  Finally, we acknowledge sources for further information.  Among her many inscrutable mysteries, my wife often scans the end of a novel before reading it through from the beginning.  But perhaps she's not so different from opera fans, who know their stories by heart, including the endings.  The fulfillment is how you get there.  Giacomo Puccini faced that challenge from the other side of the footlights in Turandot, his final opera.  He had a gripping plot brimming with passion from lust to torture, riveting characters, an exotic setting, fabulous music and a rousing conclusion, but wrestled for years how to connect them.  He died in 1924, never having figured it out and leaving a gaping hole in his masterwork.  As William Berger noted, it's indeed ironic, and perhaps fitting, that the work often cited as the very last in the 325-year line of traditional Italian opera ends not with a bang, nor even a whimper, but a question mark.  Perhaps the most telling assessment came from jazzman and populist critic Spike Hughes, who had noted \u2013 in 1957! \u2013 that as far as the general public was concerned opera had come to a full stop, with all modern work over our head, overly cerebral, and downright dull.  In that light, he distinguished Puccini as the last opera composer with any kind of lasting and truly universal popular appeal \u2013 his perceived weaknesses of cheap effects, empty bombast, shallow characters and lurid drama that critics and musicians had derided during his lifetime now have emerged as audience-pleasing virtues, essential to maintaining popularity of the genre (or perhaps only in adapting it to the cultural norms of our times).  Renowned musicologist Paul Henry Lang agrees by proffering a surprisingly indulgent salute to Puccini's sure instinct for theatrical impact, a wonderful sense of new colors, rich melodic invention, piquant harmonies and clever orchestration, all \"decadent drugs which he used to accelerate the blood circulation of his theatre.\"  Yet, Mosco Carner reflects a more balanced view of Puccini as a man of limits and contradictions treading the thin border between genius and mere talent \u2013 more heart than mind, intense but shallow characters, stupendous technical accomplishments but weak dramaturgy.  Born into the fifth generation of a family of opera composers,  Puccini frankly admitted that he had little interest in any other genre.  He wrote to his multi-talented librettist Guiseppe Adami: \"The Almighty touched me with His little finger and said, 'Write for the theatre \u2013 mind well, only for the theatre!'  And I have obeyed the supreme command.\"  Indeed he did, and in his chosen m\ufffdtier, Puccini was rewarded with an extraordinary decade of success \u2013 Manon Lescaut (1893), La Boh\ufffdme (1896), Tosca (1900) and Madame Butterfly (1904).  All profited from his acknowledged strengths while obscuring their dramatic lapses with surging passionate music and remain hugely popular mainstays of the repertory of all major opera houses.  Yet, there had been a certain homogeny.  His next three operas explored new roads, but at a price of fleeting appeal.  The Girl of the Golden West (1910) was set in the alien world of American cowboys.  Next, after delay from the War, came La Rondine (\"The Swallow\") (1917), a frothy but trite love story among the idle rich.  Boldest of all was Il Trittico (\"The Triptych\") (1918), which consisted of three complementary one-scene operas \u2013 Il Tabarro (\"The Cloak\"), an overwrought verismo melodrama of jealousy and murder, Suor Angelica (\"Sister Angelica\"), a sentimental all-female religious | Question: Prince Calef is the male-lead in which Puccini opera?", "truth": ["turandot", "turnadot"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4351", "mistake": "Turandot", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Arden was born in Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada in 1966, where she lived until the age of 24. In 1909, Florence Nightingale Graham dropped out of nursing school in Toronto.  She then joined her elder brother in New York City, working briefly as a bookkeeper for the E.R. Squibb Pharmaceuticals Company. While there, she spent hours in their lab, learning about skincare. She then worked - again briefly - for Eleanor Adair, an early beauty culturist, as a \"treatment girl\".  In 1909 Arden formed a partnership with Elizabeth Hubbard, another culturist. When the partnership dissolved, she coined the business name \"Elizabeth Arden\" from her former partner and from Tennyson's poem \"Enoch Arden\".  In 1912 Arden travelled to France to learn beauty and facial massage techniques used in the Paris beauty salons. She returned with a collection of rouges and tinted powders she had created. In an era when it was generally only acceptable for entertainers to wear makeup, Arden introduced modern eye makeup to North America. She also introduced the concept of the \"makeover\" in her salons.  In 1915 she married Thomas J. Lewis, a banker, thus becoming an American citizen. Arden's drive for success cost her marriage to Lewis. They divorced in 1934. A second marriage to a Russian prince only lasted 2 years.  Arden collaborated with A. Fabian Swanson, a chemist, to create a \"fluffy\" face cream. The success of the cream, Venetian Cream Amoretta, and corresponding lotion, Arden Skin Tonic, led to a long-lasting business relationship. This revolutionized cosmetics, bringing a scientific approach to formulations. Other innovations included creating foundations that matched a person's skin tone; creating the idea of the \"Total Look\" in which lip, cheek, and fingernail colors matched or coordinated; and the first to make a cosmetics commercial shown in movie houses.  During World War II, Arden recognized the changing needs of the American woman entering the work force. She showed women how to apply makeup and dress appropriately for careers outside the home. She created a lipstick called Montezuma Red, for the women in the armed forces that would match the red on their uniforms. Although most of her commercial success was in cosmetics, she also pioneered restorative musical exercises based on yoga. She started a fashion business in 1943 with notable designers like Charles James and Oscar de la Renta on staff.  She began expanding her international operations in 1915, and started opening salons across the world. By the end of 1930s, it was said that \"There are only three American names that are known in every single corner of the globe: Singer sewing machines, Coca Cola, and Elizabeth Arden.\" A fact proved by Heinrich Harrer in his book Seven Years in Tibet, where he stated that it's possible to buy Arden's products\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdeven in Tibet.

One of thousands of notes that carpet the wall, hers is barely noticeable. She has left it here at Casa di Giulietta, the home where Juliet Capuleti of Shakespeare\u2019s tragic love story lived, in hopes that the secretaries of Juliet will respond. It\u2019s a sweet tradition that has been observed by lovers from every age, language and background. It\u2019s also just one of connections shared between the British Bard and the country of Italy where nearly a third of his works were set.  \u201cIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene\u201d is how Shakespeare describes the setting of his most famous love story, Romeo and Juliet. So poignant is the tale that modern-day lovers still flock to the cobbled streets of Verona, if not for historical accuracy, certainly for the romance it embodies. When your travels take you to this most romantic of cities , here are some of the Shakespearean sites to see while in Verona:  The Balcony of Casa di Giulietta -- The site where Romeo is said to have declared his love to Juliet is just outside the city\u2019s main promenade. Although added to a suitably old house in 1936, and doubtfully the original, it draws romantics in droves and is often the site for many a proposal and declaration of love.  Juliet\u2019s Statue -- Set inside a courtyard entered through a little arched passageway, the small statue of a girl is a favorite for visitors to Casa di Giulietta. Before you leave, take a moment to rub the right breast of Juliet, a tradition no one seems to be able to explain.  Juliet\u2019s Tomb -- In the story, Juliet dies in a 13th century Franciscan convent. While no name is mentioned, the site at Via del Pontiere was the only one outside the city walls at the time when the events took place. Literary fans, tourists and locals alike come here to pay tribute to the tragic tale.  Basilica di San Zeno Maggiore -- Inside this church you\u2019ll find the crypt where Romeo and Juliet supposedly secreted away to be married. The Romanesque building features a \u2018wheel of fortune\u2019 rose window and 12th century bronze doors.  Piazza delle Erbe -- We don\u2019t know for sure that Romeo and Juliet ever existed but Italian poet Dante did write of two feuding families. No doubt, the Montecchi and Cappelletti clans frequented the finest square in Verona. Ringed with cafes and shops, the piazza is also home to the Baroque Palazzo Maffei and the frescoes of Casa Mazzanti.

She was killed by a suicide bomber in 2007.  IN THESE GROUPS  Famous People Who Were Assassinated  Synopsis  Benazir Bhutto was born on June 21, 1953, in Karachi, Pakistan, the child of former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She inherited leadership of the PPP after a military coup overthrew her father's government and won election in 1988, becoming the first female prime minister of a Muslim nation. In 2007, she returned to Pakistan after an extended exile, but, tragically, was killed in a suicide attack.  Early Life  Benazir Bhutto was born on June 21, 1953, in Karachi, Pakistan, the eldest child of former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She went on to found the Pakistan People's Party and serve as the nation's prime minister (from  1971 to 1977). After completing her early education in Pakistan, she  pursued her higher education in the United States. Bhutto attended Radcliffe College from 1969 to 1973, and then enrolled at Harvard University, where she  graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in comparative government. It was then onto  the United Kingdom, where she studied at Oxford University from 1973 to 1977, completing a course in international law and diplomacy.  Leader of the PPP  Bhutto  returned to Pakistan in 1977, and was placed under house arrest after  the military coup led by General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq overthrew her  father's government. One year after Zia ul-Haq became president in 1978,  the elder Bhutto was hanged after his conviction on charges of  authorizing the murder of an opponent. She inherited her father's  leadership of the PPP.  There was more family tragedy in 1980 when  Bhutto's brother Shahnawaz was killed in his apartment on the Riviera in  1980. The family insisted he was poisoned, but no charges were brought.  Another brother, Murtaza, died in 1996 (while his sister was in power)  in a gun battle with police in Karachi.  She moved to England in 1984, becoming the joint leader in exile of  the PPP, then returned to Pakistan on April 10, 1986, to launch a  nationwide campaign for open elections.

Pakistan President  Zia ul-Haq's dictatorship ended when he was killed in a  plane crash in 1988. And Bhutto was elected prime minister barely three  months after giving birth to her first child. She became the first ever  female prime minister of a Muslim nation on December 1, 1988. Bhutto was  defeated in the 1990 election, and found herself in court defending  herself against several charges of misconduct while in office. Bhutto  continued to be a prominent focus of opposition discontent, and won a  further election in 1993, but was replaced in 1996.  While in self-imposed exile in Britain and Dubai, she was convicted  in 1999 of corruption and sentenced to three years in prison. She  continued to direct her party from abroad, being re-affirmed as PPP  leader in 2002.  Bhutto returned to Pakistan on October 18, 2007,  after President Musharraf granted her amnesty on all corruption charges,  opening the way for her return as well as a possible power-sharing agreement.  Tragically, Bhutto's  homecoming rally after eight years in exile was hit by a suicide  attack, which killed 136 people. She only survived after ducking down at the  moment of impact behind her armored vehicle. Bhutto said it was  Pakistan's \"blackest day\" when Musharraf imposed a state of emergency on November 3, 2007, and threatened to bring her supporters on to the streets in mass  demonstrations.

THE QUICK & SIMPLE  Henna (Lawsonia Inermis) is a flowering plant.  The leaves of the Henna plant contain a natural and very effective coloring pigment: Lawsone.  This Orange/Red dye releases as the leaves are crushed. Drying, milling, and sifting the Henna leaves into a fine powder maximizes the pigment (Lawsone) release.  The powdered henna will activate with air and water. After mixing to a paste, you can apply directly to your hair or skin for Natural, Super-Effective coloring. Henna temporarily tattoos the body, and permanently colors hair.  The Lawsone dye molecules actually color the hair and skin by safely binding to their protein molecules. They darken as they absorb deeper into the hair and skin (bind to additional proteins). The color maxes out in about 48 hours and can naturally last for weeks.

And the best quality Henna, known for its color richness and content purity, is grown and harvested in Northwestern India.  THE LONG & DETAILED  c/o Wikipedia 2013:\u00a0 Henna (Lawsonia inermis), also called henna tree is a flowering plant used since antiquity to dye skin, hair, fingernails, leather and wool. The name is also used for dye preparations derived from the plant, and for the art of temporary tattooing based on those dyes. Additionally, the name is misused for other skin and hair dyes, such as black henna or neutral henna, which are not derived from the plant.  Small Lawsonia inermis Plant  The English name \u201chenna\u201d comes from the Arabic \u062d\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0621 (ALA-LC: \u1e25inn\u0101\u02be) or colloquially \u062d\u0646\u0627, loosely pronounced /\u0127inna/. Henna is a tall shrub or small tree, 2.6\u00a0m high. It is glabrous, multi-branched with spine tipped branchlets. Leaves are opposite, entire, glabrous, sub-sessile, elliptical, and broadly lanceolate (1.5\u20135.0\u00a0cm x 0.5\u20132\u00a0cm), acuminate, having depressed veins on the dorsal surface. Henna flowers have four sepals and a 2\u00a0mm calyx tube with 3\u00a0mm spread lobes. Petals are obvate, white or red stamens inserted in pairs on the rim of the calyx tube. Ovary is four celled, style up to 5\u00a0mm long and erect. Fruits are small, brownish capsules, 4\u20138\u00a0mm in diameter, with 32\u201349 seeds per fruit, and open irregularly into four splits.[2]  The henna plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, and northern Australasia in semi-arid zones. Henna\u2019s indigenous zone is the tropical savannah and tropical arid zone, in latitudes between 15\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 N and S from Africa to the western Pacific rim, and produces highest dye content in temperatures between 35\u00a0\u00b0C and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. During the onset of precipitation intervals, the plant grows rapidly; putting out new shoots, then growth slows. The leaves gradually yellow and fall during prolonged dry or cool intervals. It does not thrive where minimum temperatures are below 11\u00a0\u00b0C. Temperatures below 5\u00a0\u00b0C will kill the henna plant. Henna is commercially cultivated in Morocco,Algeria, Yemen, Tunisia, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, India, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Turkey, Somalia and Sudan. Presently the Pali district of Rajasthan is the most heavily cultivated henna production area in India, with over 100 henna processors operating in Sojat City.

{"input": "Context: Charles DarrowCharles Brace Darrow (August 10, 1889 \u2013 August 28, 1967) was an American best known as the claimed inventor of the Monopoly board game. He became the first millionaire game-designer in history.  Personal life  Darrow was a domestic heater salesman from Germantown, a neighborhood in Philadelphia (the part of Germantown he lived in is now called Mount Airy) during the Great Depression. The house he lived in still stands at 40 Westview Street. While Darrow eventually sold his version of Monopoly to Parker Brothers, claiming it to be his own invention, modern historians credit Darrow as just one of the game's final developers.    Monopoly  After losing his job at a sales company following the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Darrow worked at various odd jobs. Seeing his neighbors and acquaintances play a home-made board game in which the object was to buy and sell property, he decided to publish his own version of the game, with the help of his first son, William, and his wife Esther. Darrow marketed his version of the game under the name Monopoly.  In truth, Darrow was just one of many people in the American Midwest and East Coast who had been playing a game of buying and trading property. The game's direct ancestor was The Landlord's Game, created by Elizabeth Magie. The game was used by college professors and their students, and another variant, called The Fascinating Game of Finance, was published in the Midwest in the late 1920s and early 1930s. From there the game traveled back east, where it had remained popular in Pennsylvania, and became popular with a group of Quakers in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Darrow was taught to play the game by Charles Todd, who had played it in Atlantic City, where it had been customized with that city's street and property names. Darrow's version of the game, as published, was virtually identical to the version he learned from Todd.   In 2004 the PBS program History Detectives investigated a game board owned by Ron Jarrell of Arden, Delaware, which had elements of both The Landlord's Game and Monopoly. The investigators concluded that this game board \"[had] key elements in it that link the Landlord\u2019s Game and the Monopoly Game together\".   The Darrow family initially made their game sets on flexible, round pieces of oilcloth instead of rigid, square carton. Charles drew the designs of the properties with drafting pens, and his son and wife filled in the spaces with colors and made the title deed cards and Chance and Community Chest cards. On these first round boards, Darrow included some of the icons (actually designed for him by a hired graphic artist) that the later Monopoly made famous, such as the large red arrow for \"Go\", the black locomotives on the railroad spaces, the faucet on \"Water Works\" and light bulb on \"Electric Company\" and the question marks on the \"Chance\" spaces. Darrow then secured a copyright for the game in 1933. The next known versions he produced had printed 'boards' on oilcloth squares with hand colored details.   Commercial sales  By 1934, Darrow started having the game printed on cardboard, and sold copies in long white boxes to Wanamaker's Department Store in Philadelphia. Later that year, Darrow showed his game first to Milton Bradley and later to Parker Brothers. The latter company , which included the game's length and complexity.  Darrow reinvested money from the sales into smaller sets, sold in black cardboard boxes, with boards sold separately from the sets. After Darrow started to take orders from other Philadelphia department stores, Parker Brothers reconsidered.  Parker Brothers negotiated the rights from Darrow to produce the game in large scale. Darrow sought and received  on the game in 1935, which Parker Brothers acquired. Within a year, 20,000 sets of the game were being produced every week. Monopoly ended up being the best-selling board game in America that year, and it made Darrow the first millionaire game designer in history.

Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples (1914-2000), the patriarch of the family, formed the group with his children Cleotha (b. 1934), Pervis (b. 1935), Yvonne (b. 1936), and Mavis (b. 1939). They are best known for their 1970s hits \"I'll Take You There\", \"Respect Yourself\", and \"Let's Do It Again\".  The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records, Vee-Jay Records, Checker Records, Riverside Records, and then Epic Records in 1965. While the family surname is \"Staples\", the group used the singular form for its name, resulting in the group's name being \"The Staple Singers\".  It was on Epic that the Staple Singers began moving into mainstream pop markets, with \"Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\" and \"For What It's Worth\" (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper and Booker T & the MG's \u2014 Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970, Al Bell had become producer, and with Engineer Terry Manning, the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, and Memphis' Ardent Studios, moving in a more funk and soul direction.  The first Stax hit was \"Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)\". Their 1971 recording of \"Respect Yourself\", written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice, peaked at number 2 on the R&B charts and was a number 12 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972, the group had a huge No. 1 hit in the United States with \"I'll Take You There\". It topped both pop and R&B charts. \"If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)\" would become another big hit, reaching number 9 pop and number 1 on the R&B chart in 1973.  Then, after Stax's bankruptcy in 1975, they signed to Curtis Mayfield's label, Curtom Records, and released \"Let's Do It Again\", produced by Mayfield; the song became their second No. 1 pop hit in the US. In 1976, they collaborated with The Band on the song \"The Weight\" for their film The Last Waltz. However, they were not able to regain their momentum, releasing only occasional minor hits. Their 1984 album Turning Point featured their final Top 40 hit, a cover of Talking Heads' \"Slippery People\" (which also reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart). In 1994, they again performed the song \"The Weight\" with Country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville's Rhythm, Country and Blues compilation, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song \"Respect Yourself\" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie Crooklyn, made in 1994.  In 1999, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. In 2005, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

They were initially regular guests on Crackerjack, usually working in rotation with acts such as Basil Brush or The Great Suprendo, but in 1982 they got their own show The Krankies Klub.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0This was followed by The Krankies Electronik Komik in 1985 and Krankies TV in the early 1990\u2019s. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately by this time children\u2019s television was becoming a diet of cartoons and shows made in other countries, and there was no room for the more variety hall style humour of The Krankies. \u00c2\u00a0In 1991 the duo entered semi-retirement, just appearing in pantomime at Christmas.  In more recent years they have started appearing on Cruise Ships where they appear as both The Krankies and several other characters. \u00c2\u00a0They are also planning a tour with other famous names from the eighties such as Frank Carson and Jimmy Cricket.  It seems as though the character of Wee Jimmy Krankie has earned a place in many peoples hearts though, as in 2003 he (she?) was voted \u201cMost Scottish Person In The World\u201d by readers of The Glasgow Herald, and David Tennant suggested Jimmy would make an excellent Timelord to replace him on Doctor Who. \u00c2\u00a0I have to assume he was joking.  Take a look at the video below showing The Krankies in action on Crackerjack. \u00c2\u00a0It\u2019s a surprisingly clever sketch for a kids show. \u00c2\u00a0Comedy gold!  The KrankiesThe Krankies are a Scottish comedy duo who enjoyed success as a cabaret act in the 1970s and on television in the 1980s, featuring in their own television shows and releasing their own music single. They have regularly appeared in pantomime. The duo comprises wife Janette Tough and her husband Ian. As the Krankies they portray schoolboy Wee Jimmy Krankie (Janette), and paternal figure Ian Krankie (Ian), though in their comedy act they also portray other characters. Beginning in the 1990s, they regularly appeared as The Krankies in episodes of the BBC comedy series French and Saunders.  Biographies  Janette was born on 16 May 1947 in Queenzieburn, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, and Ian on 26 March 1947 in Glasgow, Scotland. The two met in 1966, and were married in 1969.  Career  They began their career as a comedy duo performing various characters, working the comedy circuit. In 1978 they got their \"big break\" when they were given a place at the Royal Variety Performance.  Television  During the 1980s they were given roles in several television shows, including the BBC's stalwart children's entertainment series Crackerjack.  * Crackerjack (1980\u20131982)  *The Krankies Klub  (1983\u20131984)  *The Joke Machine (1985)  *The Krankies Elektronik Komik  (1985\u20131987)  *K.T.V  for Border Television (1989\u20131992)  Music  In early 1981 they released a couple of singles.  * \"Fan - Dabi - Dozi\", their catchphrase, peaked at number 46 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1981. | Question: What is the stage name of double act 'Ian and Janet Tough?", "truth": ["janette krankie", "ian tough", "krankies"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7411", "mistake": "The Krankies", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Alfred Nobel was a man of many disciplines -- including science, invention, entrepreneurship, literature, and peace. When he passed away in 1896, he dedicated his will to award those who have been outstanding figures in these fields. As a result, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation was established and became the organization responsible for awarding the Nobel Prizes.  According to Alfred Nobel\u2019s will, the Nobel Peace Prize shall be awarded to those who have \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"  The Nobel Peace Prize is an international award that is awarded every year by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The prize ceremony takes place annually on December 10, the date on which Alfred Nobel passed away. The prize usually includes a medal, personal diploma, and award money.

Our story starts in 1906 when Theodore Roosevelt became the first President to win a Nobel Peace Prize. Since then, three other Presidents and one Vice President have received the honor.  Below is a list of recipients from the White House:  President Woodrow Wilson in 1920, for his efforts in ending the First World War and help in creating the League of Nations.  President Jimmy Carter in 2002, for his efforts in finding \u201cpeaceful solutions to international conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights, and promoting economic and social development.\u201d  Vice President Al Gore in 2007, for his efforts to obtain and spread knowledge about climate change.

{"input": "Context: Think the Earth | 012 EarthriumThink the Earth | 012 Earthrium  \u2190Back  The formation of supercontinents  The Earth was born around 4.6 billion years ago, after which it has continued to evolve for a considerable length of time. Based on evidence found in rock formations, it is thought that by 4.4 billion years ago oceans and continents had already formed.  Research into such things as plate tectonics and plume tectonics (see Part 4: Earthquakes around the world) have advanced to the stage where it is has been concluded that from around two billion years ago, so-called supercontinents containing all the present-day continents were forming every 400-500 million years.  Recent studies have revealed quite a lot of detail about the formation and breaking up of these supercontinents up to around 600 million years ago. This is due to advances in a field of study known as paleomagnetism, which involves looking into the extent of continental drift by searching for rock formations that contain records of the Earth's magnetic field over time and then measuring the ages of these rock formations. The images used in this edition of Earthrium were provided by Dr. Ronald Blakey, a geologist at Northern Arizona University.  Well then, just what kind of supercontinents existed on Earth all those years ago? The following is a brief description of the supercontinents we currently know existed.  Neuna  Neuna was the Earth's first supercontinent and was formed around 1.9 billion years ago. We know that it broke up soon after it formed, but it is difficult to determine what form it took. The name Neuna was given to the continent by the Harvard University geologist Dr. Paul Hoffman, and is an acronym that derives from Northern Europe and North America. Traces of the orogenic activity of 1.9 billion years ago can still be found in various locations around the world, and on the basis of these it is thought that most of the landmass that currently makes up the continent of North America was once part of the Neuna supercontinent.  Rodinia  This supercontinent is thought to have existed from between one billion and 700 million years ago. It is now thought that before it started breaking apart, there was a major ice age that froze the entire surface of the Earth, including the ocean in the vicinity of the equator. Because when viewed from space the Earth would probably have resembled a huge lump of white snow, this theory has been labeled the Snowball Earth hypothesis.  According to one theory, during the Neuna and Rodinia periods there existed another supercontinent known as Colombia (1.5 billion years ago), although at this stage little is known about this supercontinent.  Gondwana  Gondwana was a new supercontinent that formed after Rodinia broke up. Most of it is thought to have been located in the southern hemisphere. If you click on \"600 million years ago\" at the bottom of the globe at left you'll notice a large continent in the form of a single landmass in the southern hemisphere. The supercontinent of Gondwana included the present-day continents of Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica, as well as the Indian subcontinent.  Pangaea  The supercontinent of Pangaea formed around 290 million years ago. It began to break apart some 250 million years ago, eventually separating into the six continents that exist today. Two hundred and fifty million years ago was also when the Earth's most severe extinction event occurred. It is thought that this extinction event is probably closely related to the break up of Pangaea, and extensive research is currently being carried out around the world to determine the exact relationship between the two events.  Supercontinents of the future  We know that at present the continents are all drifting in the direction of Asia. If this trend continues, the first thing that will happen, some 50 million years from now, is that Australia will collide with the Japanese archipelago. Next, some 200 to 300 million years in the future according to one theory, Africa and the Arabian peninsula, and then America will merge with Asia, possibly forming a single supercontinent known as Amasia.

Its male partner is called a cob. The pen's offspring that is one year or younger is called a cygnet.  Full Answer  A pen usually breeds in late April to the beginning of May. She lays a white egg every other day until it totals between five to nine eggs. While she incubates them for over 30 days, the cob defends the nest against possible predators. The newly born cygnets take to the water after one to two days. The cygnets' initial foods consist mainly of invertebrates and plants.

Between them they starred in more than 100 West End plays and, in the 1940s and 1950s, were familiar figures in British films. On screen they co-starred in My Brother Jonathan and The Glass Mountain in 1948, The Franchise Affair in 1950 and the Battle of Britain movie Angels One Five in 1952. In 1983, both were awarded the CBE.  Dulcie Gray and Michael Denison  As an actress, Dulcie Gray somehow lacked individuality. Though she and Michael Denison made a good team, it was difficult to think of her as a star in her own right, and this is doubtless why she never won meaty screen parts independently of her husband. She was sometimes compared \u2014 and not to her advantage \u2014 with Googie Withers, who was her contemporary and also enjoyed a long marriage to her regular co-star, John McCallum.  Acting, however, was only one of Dulcie Gray\u2019s talents. She was also a prolific writer and an expert on butterflies. She wrote some two dozen murder mysteries, which found wide popularity, eight radio plays, several volumes of short stories and an autobiography (Looking Forward, Looking Back). With Michael Denison, she wrote some thoughts on her craft for young children, An Actor and His World.  She also wrote one play (Love Affair), in which she co-starred with her husband, who also directed. Despite long theatrical experience, writing for the stage was not her forte. The play opened to a savage review from Kenneth Tynan, who fulminated that it shattered three cardinal rules: \u201cactresses should not write plays, playwrights should not act in their own plays and directors should not appear in their own productions\u201d. And he added a fourth rule as a coda: \u201cactors should not marry\u201d. The Denisons were mortally offended and considered legal action. Dulcie Gray never wrote another play.  Her principal achievement as a writer was Butterflies on My Mind, a scholarly study of the insects written in 1978 that went on to win the Times Educational Senior Information Book Award.  Dulcie Bailey was born in Kuala Lumpur on November 20 1915, the daughter of a judge. She was educated in England at private schools in Wallingford, Wokingham and Swanage but in her late teens returned to the East, where she began work as a journalist for the Malaya Tribune.  She also wrote and broadcast songs on the radio. One of them, You Tickle Me Spitless, Baby, achieved some local acclaim.  Though keen on amateur theatricals, she never intended to become an actress, thinking instead of journalism or teaching. Indeed for a time she held a teaching post in the Malayan jungle. Accepting a job at a school in England, she worked her passage home, but was unable to take up the position because she then badly broke her arm.  At a loose end, she competed initially for a painting scholarship at the Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant studio at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in London. She won and spent three months there but soon found that art was not her m\u00e9tier. So she tried for a place at the Webber Douglas drama school and was again successful.  It was there that she met Michael Denison, with whom she first acted six months later in a play about the Irish leader Charles Stewart Parnell (Dulcie Gray played his inamorata, Kitty O\u2019Shea). Much smitten with his co-star, Denison sent her half a dozen roses (all he could afford at 7s 6d a bloom), with a note \u201cTo Kitty, from Charles Stewart\u201d. She came to his dressing room at the interval and exclaimed \u201cWould you believe?

{"input": "Context: Decriminalizing Drugs in Portugal a Success, Says ... - TIMEDecriminalizing Drugs in Portugal a Success, Says Report - TIME  Follow @TIME  Pop quiz: Which European country has the most liberal drug laws? (Hint: It's not the Netherlands.)  Although its capital is notorious among stoners and college kids for marijuana haze\u0096filled \"coffee shops,\" Holland has never actually legalized cannabis \u0097 the Dutch simply don't enforce their laws against the shops. The correct answer is Portugal, which in 2001 became the first European country to officially abolish all criminal penalties for personal possession of drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine.  At the recommendation of a national commission charged with addressing Portugal's drug problem, jail time was replaced with the offer of therapy. The argument was that the fear of prison drives addicts underground and that incarceration is more expensive than treatment \u0097 so why not give drug addicts health services instead? Under Portugal's new regime, people found guilty of possessing small amounts of drugs are sent to a panel consisting of a psychologist, social worker and legal adviser for appropriate treatment (which may be refused without criminal punishment), instead of jail.  (See the world's most influential people in the 2009 TIME 100.)  The question is, does the new policy work? At the time, critics in the poor, socially conservative and largely Catholic nation said decriminalizing drug possession would open the country to \"drug tourists\" and exacerbate Portugal's drug problem; the country had some of the highest levels of hard-drug use in Europe. But the recently released results of a report commissioned by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, suggest otherwise.  The paper, published by Cato in April, found that in the five years after personal possession was decriminalized, illegal drug use among teens in Portugal declined and rates of new HIV infections caused by sharing of dirty needles dropped, while the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction more than doubled.  \"Judging by every metric, decriminalization in Portugal has been a resounding success,\" says Glenn Greenwald, an attorney, author and fluent Portuguese speaker, who conducted the research. \"It has enabled the Portuguese government to manage and control the drug problem far better than virtually every other Western country does.\"  Compared to the European Union and the U.S., Portugal's drug use numbers are impressive. Following decriminalization, Portugal had the lowest rate of lifetime marijuana use in people over 15 in the E.U.: 10%. The most comparable figure in America is in people over 12: 39.8%. Proportionally, more Americans have used cocaine than Portuguese have used marijuana.  The Cato paper reports that between 2001 and 2006 in Portugal, rates of lifetime use of any illegal drug among seventh through ninth graders fell from 14.1% to 10.6%; drug use in older teens also declined. Lifetime heroin use among 16-to-18-year-olds fell from 2.5% to 1.8% (although there was a slight increase in marijuana use in that age group). New HIV infections in drug users fell by 17% between 1999 and 2003, and deaths related to heroin and similar drugs were cut by more than half. In addition, the number of people on methadone and buprenorphine treatment for drug addiction rose to 14,877 from 6,040, after decriminalization, and money saved on enforcement allowed for increased funding of drug-free treatment as well.  Portugal's case study is of some interest to lawmakers in the U.S., confronted now with the violent overflow of escalating drug gang wars in Mexico. The U.S. has long championed a hard-line drug policy, supporting only international agreements that enforce drug prohibition and imposing on its citizens some of the world's harshest penalties for drug possession and sales. Yet America has the highest rates of cocaine and marijuana use in the world, and while most of the E.U. (including Holland) has more liberal drug laws than the U.S., it also has less drug use.  \"I think we can learn that we should stop being reflexively opposed when someone else does [decriminalize] and should take seriously the possibility that anti-user enforcement isn't having much | Question: Which country in 2001 became the first to decriminalize recreational drug use?", "truth": ["portugual", "portugal"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2450", "mistake": "Portugal", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Context: Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) - James Bond Wiki ...Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) | James Bond Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee)  The Man with the Golden Gun, Paco, Pistols  Age  Francisco Scaramanga is the main villain in the James Bond film and novel The Man with the Golden Gun . Scaramanga was played by the late English actor Christopher Lee , who was also Ian Fleming 's cousin.  Contents  Film biography  Background  Francisco Scaramanga was a British national born in a traveling circus. His father was the ringmaster, a former\u00a0 Cuban \u00a0national and his mother was a snake charmer. By the age of ten, he was part of the circus as a trick-shot pistol marksman; a skill which he put to use when\u00a0he shot and killed an abusive animal trainer after the man killed an elephant that had befriended Scaramanga.\u00a0  By fifteen, he was a gunman in Rio de Janeiro. He was recruited there by the\u00a0 KGB \u00a0and trained in Eastern Europe where for many years he was basically just another overworked and underpaid assassin for the KGB. He quit the KGB in the late 1950s, becoming an independent hitman-for-hire.\u00a0All of Scaramanga's dealings go through his diminutive accomplice\u00a0 Nick Nack , which allows Scaramanga to remain anonymous.\u00a0No photographs of him exist, but he has unusual anatomy: a\u00a0 third nipple .\u00a0As in the novel, it is shown that Scaramanga makes love prior to killing in the belief that it 'improves the eye'.  During the events of the film, he is at the very apex of his career. Consequently, Scaramanga lives very well, drawing from the exorbitant sums of money he charges to carry out his assassinations (\"Current price, one million dollars\", according to Bond's briefing), and has built his home on his own private island somewhere off the coast of south-eastern China \u00a0(apparently part of a deal with the Chinese to carry out assassinations in return). Scaramanga lives alone, accompanied only by Nick Nack, Andrea Anders (his kept woman), and a mechanic named Kra who is in charge of maintenance and security.  Scaramanga also uses some of his wealth to finance research and development of technologies that rival those developed by MI6's Q Branch . Such technologies include\u00a0his infamous\u00a0 Golden Gun , a car that transforms into an aircraft and a solar-powered laser cannon. In addition, Scaramanga also has a private junk, which Bond later steals to get off the exploding island.  The Solex Agitator  Hiding on a rooftop, Scaramanga prepares to kill Gibson.  In addition to his career as an assassin, Scaramanga is also a junior partner in Hai Fat Enterprises and personal assassin to the company's owner,\u00a0multimillionaire industrialist\u00a0 Hai Fat . Prior to the film's events, a British scientist named Gibson was employed by Hai Fat\u00a0to develop a solution to the world's ongoing\u00a0 energy crisis . With the help of Fat's construction company, a highly efficient solar powerplant is constructed on Scaramanga's island. However, following its completion, Gibson attempts to return to Britain; bargaining for immunity with a critical component of the powerplant: the\u00a0 Solex Agitator unit.  Having outlived his usefulness, Francisco is dispatched by Hai Fat to assassinate the scientist and recover the Solex. After meeting with his British contact at a Hong Kong club, Gibson is assassinated and his invention is stolen from the crime scene by Nick Nack. Scaramanga initially returns the device to Fat, but following James Bond 's interference, he instead decides to kill his employer and take the Solex, powerplant and company for himself. With Hai Fat's assets in his possession, the assassin plans to sell Gibson's solar technology to the highest bidder, which was a huge concern given the recent events of the 1973 oil crisis. Criminality was of no concern to Scaramanga; anyone who paid up would be the new owner.

They eat quickly for a minute, than meander off to the next anthill leaving the colony to recover.  Plus, they are MASSIVE! Giant anteaters can be over two metres long, roughly seven feet.  Three feet of that length is all tail baby. Long, hairy tail. Not quite long enough (by inches!) to rival that of the giraffe, sadly. Still\u2026 you know\u2026 I was pretty close.

{"input": "Context: Hilda OgdenHilda Alice Ogden (n\u00e9e Crabtree) is a fictional character from the  British television series Coronation Street, one of the best-known of all the regular characters in the soap opera,  whose name became synonymous with a certain type of working-class woman. She was played by Jean Alexander from 1964 to 1987.  For much of her period as a character in the Street, Hilda worked as cleaner of the Rover's Return Inn. A gossip and busy-body, many of her storylines were used for comedic purposes, though equally the character was used for dramatic effect; a scene in which she wept over the sight of her recently deceased husband's spectacles has been hailed as one of the most moving images in television history.  Actress Jean Alexander quit the role in 1987 after 23 years, but was persuaded to reprise the part in 1990 for a one-off appearance as part of an ITV Telethon. She has also been seen in a spin-off video in 1998, in which another long-running character, Betty Williams, visited her at her new home.  Arguably the serial's most popular character of all time, Hilda was voted the greatest TV character in a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people. The trademark image of Hilda, wearing hair curlers and a head scarf, has inspired art and catwalk themes. Despite various producers expressing their desire to see the character return, actress Jean Alexander has been openly critical about the direction Coronation Street has taken, vowing never to reprise the role of Hilda again.  Alexander had previously appeared in 1962 as Mrs. Webb, the landlady of Joan Akers, who abducted Christopher Hewitt.  Development  Characterisation  Hilda Ogden, with her trademark hair curlers and pinny, has been described as \"the classic hard-working class Northern woman. With a voice like breaking glass and a temper to match\".  Actress Jean Alexander has explained her interpretation of Hilda's head scarf and curler look: \"Like Hilda, my roots were in Liverpool and that\u2019s where I first noticed the curlers and headscarf look. The curlers were put under the headscarf by the factory girls [...] They had their hair tied up and scarves like that to stop their fashionable long hair getting caught up in the machinery at work. They had the curlers in place in case they got asked out on a date, so they\u2019d be ready for a night out after the shift. They could just take off the headscarf, remove the curlers and shake down their hair. Hilda\u2019s background was just like mine and her recollection would have been the same so the headscarf look was born on-screen.\"  Alexander stated in 2010 that she based Hilda on bits of differing, eccentric people she had seen in her youth in Liverpool.      A term that has been described as synonymous with Hilda Ogden is \"busy body\". Critic for The Guardian, Grace Dent, has suggested that Hilda \"spent the 70s providing an unofficial town-crier service for Coronation Street scandal. Hilda was known to sleep propped up in bed with one eye open so she could see what time Ken Barlow's female friends left. (Or what time they were carried out in bodybags. Ken's never had much luck with women.)\" She added that Hilda was the mould that other popular soap gossips were made from, including Dot Cotton from EastEnders, Lynda Snell from The Archers and Martha Huber from Desperate Housewives.   The Ogdens  The Ogdens, Hilda and her husband Stan (Bernard Youens), have been hailed as one of Coronation Street's favourite couples. The bickering pair stayed together through mishap and financial difficulty. A working-class couple, they remained a screen doubleact for 20 years, until actor Bernard Youens died on 27 August 1984, forcing the writers of the soap to kill off Stan on-screen. A scene following Stan's screen funeral, showing Hilda weeping at the sight of Stan's signature spectacles, has been described as \"one of the most moving moments in TV history\" and \"instrumental in winning [Jean Alexander] the Royal Television Society's | Question: \"Who played the part of Hilda Ogden for many years in the TV series, \"\"Coronation St\"\"?\" ?", "truth": ["jean alexander"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4165", "mistake": "Jean Alexander", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

If you suffer injustice, console yourself; the true unhappiness is in doing it.  Good means not merely not to do wrong, but rather not to desire to do wrong.  By desiring little, a poor man makes himself rich.  Do not trust all men, but trust men of worth; the former course is silly, the latter a mark of prudence.  Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul.  Hope of ill gain is the beginning of loss.

It is godlike ever to think on something beautiful and on something new.  This entry was posted in quote . Bookmark the permalink .  05/05/2012 at 6:13 pm  Democritus (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, D\u0113mokritos, \u201cchosen of the people\u201d) (ca. 460 BC \u2013 ca. 370 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher born in Abdera, Thrace, Greece. He was an influential pre-Socratic philosopher and pupil of Leucippus, who formulated an atomic theory for the cosmos.  His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the nineteenth-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however their ideas rested on very different bases. Largely ignored in ancient Athens, Democritus was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born philosopher Aristotle. Plato is said to have disliked him so much that he wished all his books burned. Many consider Democritus to be the \u201cfather of modern science\u201d.  We know that he wrote on Babylon and Meroe; he must also have visited Egypt, and Diodorus Siculus states that he lived there for five years. He himself declared that among his contemporaries none had made greater journeys, seen more countries, and met more scholars than himself. He particularly mentions the Egyptian mathematicians, whose knowledge he praises. Theophrastus, too, spoke of him as a man who had seen many countries. During his travels, according to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, he became acquainted with the Chaldean magi. A certain \u201cOstanes\u201d, one of the magi accompanying Xerxes was also said to have taught him.  After returning to his native land he occupied himself with natural philosophy. He traveled throughout Greece to acquire a knowledge of its culture. He mentions many Greek philosophers in his writings, and his wealth enabled him to purchase their writings. Leucippus, the founder of the atomism, was the greatest influence upon him. He also praises Anaxagoras. Diogenes Laertius says that he was friends with Hippocrates. He may have been acquainted with Socrates, but Plato does not mention him and Democritus himself is quoted as saying, \u201cI came to Athens and no one knew me.\u201d Aristotle placed him among the pre-Socratic natural philosophers.  The many anecdotes about Democritus, especially in Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, attest to his disinterest, modesty, and simplicity, and show that he lived exclusively for his studies. One story has him deliberately blinding himself in order to be less disturbed in his pursuits; it may well be true that he lost his sight in old age. He was cheerful, and was always ready to see the comical side of life, which later writers took to mean that he always laughed at the foolishness of people.  He was highly esteemed by his fellow-citizens, \u201cbecause,\u201d as Diogenes La\u00ebrtius says, \u201che had foretold them some things which events proved to be true,\u201d which may refer to his knowledge of natural phenomena. According to Diodorus Siculus, Democritus died at the age of 90, which would put his death around 370 BC, but other writers have him living to 104, or even 109.

{"input": "Context: Second DoctorThe Second Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who. He was portrayed by character actor Patrick Troughton.  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change.  The transformation into the Second Doctor (originally referred to as a \"renewal\"), a figure who was the same 'essential' character as the first but with a very different persona, was a turning point in the evolution of the series, and eventually became a critical element of the series' longevity.  Biography  The First Doctor grew progressively weaker while battling the Cybermen during the events of The Tenth Planet  and eventually collapsed, seemingly from old age. His body renewed itself and transformed into the Second Doctor.  Initially, the relationship between the Second Doctor and his predecessor was unclear. In his first story, the Second Doctor referred to his predecessor in the third person as if he were a completely different person. His companions Ben and Polly are at first unsure how to treat him and it is only when a Dalek recognises him that they accept that he is the Doctor.  In the second story, The Highlanders, Jamie McCrimmon joined the TARDIS crew, and remained with the Second Doctor for the rest of his travels. Ben and Polly left together when the TARDIS landed at Gatwick Airport on the same day they originally left with the First Doctor, after they had stopped the mass kidnapping of tourists by shape shifting aliens. The Doctor and Jamie then became involved in a plot by the Daleks to gain both the \"Human and Dalek Factors\" when the TARDIS was stolen, which led to them meeting Victoria Waterfield in the 19th century. The Doctor used the situation to engineer a Dalek civil war that seemingly destroyed the Daleks forever. However, Victoria's father was among the casualties. Now an orphan, Victoria chose to accompany the Doctor and Jamie on their travels. Although she felt great affection for the Doctor and Jamie, she was never able to completely come to terms with life in the TARDIS and the constant danger that resulted. She eventually chose to leave after the events of Fury from the Deep and was adopted by someone in the 20th Century. The Doctor was then joined by Zoe Heriot, an extremely intelligent (if overly dependent on logic) woman from the 21st century, who helped defeat the Cybermen attack on a space station known as the Wheel. She then stowed away in the TARDIS and, despite the Doctor's warnings about what she might encounter, chose to remain.  During his second incarnation, the Doctor confronted familiar foes such as the Daleks and the Cybermen, as well as new enemies such as the Great Intelligence and the Ice Warriors. It was during this time that he first met Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, in the tunnels of the London Underground. Following the defeat of the Great Intelligence, Lethbridge-Stewart was promoted to Brigadier and became the leader of the British contingent of UNIT, a military organisation tasked to investigate and defend the world from extraterrestrial threats. The Doctor reteamed with him to defeat an invasion of Cybermen in league with industrialist Tobias Vaughan.  The Second Doctor's time came to an end when the TARDIS landed in the middle of a warzone, created by a race of alien warlords who, with the help of another renegade Time Lord the War Chief, progressively kidnapped and brainwashed humans into becoming soldiers for them, hoping to use the ones who survived to conquer the Galaxy. Although the Doctor was able to defeat their plan, he realised he would be unable to return the human subjects to their various original points in Earth's history. He therefore contacted the Time Lords, sacrificing his own freedom in the process, and despite an attempt to escape was forced to return to his home planet. He was then put on trial by the Time Lords, for breaking their laws of non-interference.

He was 74.  (credit: Evan Agostini/Getty Images)  NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Percy Sledge, who soared from part-time singer and hospital orderly to lasting fame with his aching, forlorn performance on the classic \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman,\u201d died Tuesday in Louisiana. He was 74.  Dr. William \u201cBeau\u201d Clark, coroner for East Baton Rouge Parish, confirmed to The Associated Press that Sledge died early Tuesday morning, about an hour after midnight, of natural causes in hospice care.  A No. 1 hit in 1966, \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was Sledge\u2019s debut single, an almost unbearably heartfelt ballad with a resonance he never approached again. Few singers could have. Its mood set by a mournful organ and dirge-like tempo, \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was for many the definitive soul ballad, a testament of blinding, all-consuming love haunted by fear and graced by overwhelming emotion.  \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was a personal triumph for Sledge , who seemed on the verge of sobbing throughout the production, and a breakthrough for Southern soul. It was the first No. 1 hit from Alabama\u2019s burgeoning Muscle Shoals music scene, where Aretha Franklin and the Rolling Stones among others would record, and the first gold record for Atlantic Records.  Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler later called the song \u201ca transcendent moment\u201d and \u201ca holy love hymn.\u201d Sledge\u2019s hit became a standard that sustained his long touring career in the U.S., Europe and South Africa, when he averaged 100 performances a year, and led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. It was a favorite at weddings \u2014 Sledge himself did the honors at a ceremony for musician and actor Steve Van Zandt \u2014 and often turned up in movies, including \u201cThe Big Chill,\u201d \u201dThe Crying Game\u201d and a 1994 Meg Ryan drama named for the song\u2019s title.  \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was re-released after being featured in Oliver Stone\u2019s Vietnam War film \u201cPlatoon\u201d in 1987 and reached No. 2 in Britain. Michael Bolton topped the charts in the 1990s with a cover version and Rolling Stone magazine later ranked it No. 53 on its list of the greatest songs of all time.  Recognizable by his wide, gap-toothed smile, Sledge had a handful of other hits between 1966 and 1968, including \u201cWarm and Tender Love,\u201d \u201dIt Tears Me Up,\u201d \u201dOut of Left Field\u201d and \u201cTake Time to Know Her.\u201d He returned to the charts in 1974 with \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Everything.\u201d  Percy Sledge, who sang 'When a Man Loves a Woman,' diesPercy Sledge, who sang 'When a Man Loves a Woman,' dies  FacebookEmail Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest  Percy Sledge, who sang 'When a Man Loves a Woman,' dies  A No. 1 hit in 1966, \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" was Percy Sledge's debut single, a heartfelt ballad with a resonance that led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.

It                          took six months for Cortez and Montezuma to finally meet.                          Before this first meeting, Montezuma was anxious to meet                          Cortez, but was unsure about those that accompanied Cortez.                          Montezuma had sent forth messengers to send Cortez' man                          gifts of gold if they would turn back, but Montezuma's                          requests were not obeyed. When the two did finally meet                          in the city of Tenoshtitlan, the two men and completely                          differant ideas of what was going on.  Cortez                          saw the power of the Aztec Empire; he saw Montezuma adorned                          with gold and precious stones, and he wondered how much                          more was hidden away elsewhere. Such power, he thought                          would surely be suited to his home country of Spain. It                          became his mission to convert Montezuma to Catholicism,                          to make Montezuma loyal to Spain, and to plunder the wealthy                          Aztec Empire.  Montezuma                          was uncertain whether Cortez really was Quetzalcoatl,                          the god from the east, but he felt that Cortez must have                          been sent from the gods. Feeling that he might be holding a long foretold destiny in his hands, Montezuma wanted                          to appease Cortez with the religious practices that were                          a custom for the Aztec people. It must have troubled Montezuma                          to hear Cortez asking for gold and riches. Montezuma must                          have thought that if the gods wanted their treasure back,                          it was theirs to take, even if it saddened the Aztec people.  As                          Montezuma toured his guest through Tenochtitlan, Cortez                          saw how many followers Montezuma had, and wondered if                          Montezuma wanted to do away with him and his travelers.                          Cortez thought it would be wise to make Montezuma his                          prisoner before Montezuma changed his opinion of the Spanish.                          That night, Cortez talked with Montezuma and told Montezuma                          about Catholicism, and hoped that Montezuma would become                          loyal to Spain. Montezuma was kind, but refused.  After                          the fourth day, Cortez took action and made the Aztec                          ruler his prisoner. Cortez ordered the Aztec people to                          give him and his followers all the gold and wealth that                          they possessed. The authority that Montezuma had once                          possessed began to crumble as fights and skirmishes began                          to pop up through the great city, which Montezuma made                          no effort to stop. During one of the biggest fights in                          the Tenochtitlan, Montezuma came out into the city, and                          was killed. The Aztec accounts. said that the Spanish                          killed their great ruler. The Spanish accounts said that                          the Aztecs killed their own ruler.  After                          Tinochtitlan's defeat, Cortez went on to conquer the rest                          of the Aztec Empire. Although they were outnumbered by                          a hundred to one, the Spanish's superior weaponry gave                          them an an advantage. The best weapons proved to be their                          horses and their cannon. The cannon was inaccurate and                          clumsy, but the loud noise did much to frighten the Aztecs                          who had never before seen such a device.

Mike said: oh,no,you are wrong.I have found as below for this question(What is the main ingredient of Borsht (Borsch), a renowned Russian soup?),it will help you,my kids.  Answer:  Borscht is a vegetable soup, usually including beet roots, which give it a strong red color. However other, non-beet varieties exist, such as the tomato paste-based orange borscht and the sorrel-based green borscht.  There are local variations in the basic borscht recipe:  In Russian cuisine, it usually includes beets, often meat, and cabbage and optionally potatoes.  In Ukrainian and Belarusian the beets are standard, in addition to tomatoes. Potatoes and cabbage are both optional. It is usually served with smetana (cream), and tradition requires it to be served with small hot breads topped with fresh chopped garlic - pampushki  In Polish cuisine, the beets are not standard. Besides the Ukrainian style beet soup Polish people enjoy a white Easter borscht. White borscht is made from a base of fermented rye flour usually added to a broth of boiled white fresh kielbasa (after the base is added, the soup mustn't be boiled). It is served hot with cubed rye bread and diced hard-boiled eggs added to the broth, often horseradish is added to taste.  In East Prussia sour cream (Schmand) and beef was served with the Beetenbartsch (lit. beetroot-borscht).  In Lithuanian cuisine, dried mushrooms are often added. There is also a cold borscht (?altibar?iai) which has a very different taste and appearance.  In Romanian cuisine, it is the name for any sour soup, prepared usually with fermented wheat bran (which is also called bor?). In fact, the Romanian gastronomy uses with no discrimination the words ciorb? (Turkish), bor? or, sometimes, zeam?/acritur? (Romanian descriptives)  In Armenian cuisine, it is served warm with fresh sour cream.  In Doukhobor cuisine, the main ingredient is cabbage, and the soup also contains beets, potatoes, tomatoes and heavy cream along with dill and leeks. This style of borscht is orange in colour, and is always eaten hot.  In Hong Kong-style western cuisine, it includes tomatoes instead of beets, and also beef, cabbage, potatoes, bell peppers and carrots. Sometimes chili pepper is added.  In Mennonite cuisine, borscht is a generic term for soup.  While the base for borscht is often meat stock, this version is only suitable for non-Lenten seasons among some Christian communities that observe Lent.  A simpler vegan version made with vegetable stock is eaten during Lenten and fasting periods, which is called Fasting Borscht.  Borscht can be prepared and served either hot or cold. It is also often accompanied by sour cream (like East European smetana) or whipping cream.  beets  2 cloves garlic, mashed  Salt to taste  Bring water to  a boil. Add potatoes, parsley and salt.

{"input": "Context: Niagara Falls : The Islands - A HistoryNiagara Falls : The Islands - A History  Niagara Falls  A History of the Niagara River  Islands  Goat Island (American)  Goat Island was named by John Stedman in the 1770's.  John Stedman had been named \"Master of the Portage\" by British General - Sir William Johnson. With his assignment, Stedman was given the task of reorganizing the methods of transporting material along the portage of the Niagara River including the difficult climb at the Niagara Escarpment  .  On September 14th 1763, John Stedman was leading one such supply convoy which was traveling southward along the overhanging ledge along the Niagara Gorge that the Seneca Indians called Devil's Hole. Here the Seneca Indians attacked the wagon train killing eighty citizens and British soldiers. Stedman was one of only two survivors of the bloody Devil's Hole Massacre.  In August of 1764, in order to make amends with the British, the Seneca Indians ceded to the British a four mile wide strip of land along the east side of the Niagara River from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie. In addition, the Seneca Indians also ceded all the islands upstream of the Falls to Sir William Johnson.  Stedman claimed the land and islands above the Falls for himself. He claimed this land was given to him by the Seneca Indians after the peace talks with the British in 1764.  Stedman lived with his brothers Phillip and William in the first house to be build near the Falls by Fort Schlosser.  John Stedman named the island - Goat Island.\u00a0 Stedman used to raise a herd of goats on Goat Island during the 1770's. He had cleared approximately ten acres of land on this island. During the extremely cold winter of 1780, all but one of the goats died.  John Stedman left Niagara in 1795. Stedman left his property under the care of his friend Jesse Ware. Profits from Stedman's sawmill were sent to Stedman until 1797.  In 1801, Stedman lost possession of his land including Goat Island to the State of New York.  General Augustus Porter, a United States Commissioner, renamed Goat Island to Iris Island, after the Greek Goddess of the Rainbow. People resisted this name change and the island soon reverted back to its original name of Goat Island.  By 1806, Goat Island had little development. Bears and wolves were common sights along with a plentiful deer population.  In 1816, Augustus Porter bought Goat Island from the State of New York. In 1817, he built a wooden bridge from the mainland to the upper end of the island. This bridge was destroyed by ice during the following winter. In 1818, Porter built another bridge to Goat Island but closer to the Falls. In 1856, this bridge was replaced with an iron bridge.  On July 15th 1885, the State of New York created the New York State Niagara Reservation Park.  \u00a0  \u00a0  Three Sisters Islands (American)  The Three Sisters Islands (actually four islands exist) are located approximately 500 yards east of the Horseshoe Falls along the south/east side of Goat Island. In 1843, these islands were called Moss Islands because the rock surfaces of the islands were covered in moss.  The largest and closest island to the Goat island shore was known by local citizens as Deer Island.  The Sister Islands were named after the three daughters of General Parkhurst Whitney. General Whitney was an American commander during the War of 1812. Following the war, General Whitney became a very successful and prosperous businessman. He owned and operated the Cataract Hotel in Niagara Falls, New York.  In the Spring of 1816, General Whitney took his three daughters: Asenath, Angeline and Celinda Eliza to visit the islands. On this visit, General Whitney and his three daughters became the first to visit the third outer most island. This was possible because an ice jamb upstream of the Falls had reduced the dangerous rapids which normally prevented safe access to this island to a mere trickle and ice clogged the water channel. At the time no bridges to any of the islands existed.

{"input": "Context: Henry Kissinger - Northern Virginia Community College ...Henry Kissinger  What was Henry Kissinger's role in formulating US foreign policy during the Nixon Administration?  \u00a0  \u00a0  Henry Kissinger, one of America's most controversial foreign policy advisors, has been lauded for his many accomplishments during his tenure as National Security Adviser under President Nixon and Secretary of State for both Nixon and President Ford.\u00a0 He is credited with some for \"thawing\" US diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and he helped to bring about the end of American intervention in Vietnam. Kissinger's successed in foreign policy, however, have also arroused much criticism.\u00a0 In fact, many of his critics accuse him of war crimes.  Kissinger, a German Jew, was born on 23 May 1923, in the Bavarian city of Fuerth. His family immigrated to London in 1938 after it had become clear what Hitler's intentions were.\u00a0 The family then moved to New York city. Kissinger attended high school at night and worked in a factory during the day. While attending City College of New York in 1943, he was drafted into the Army, where he began his public career as a German interpreter. After Germany surrendered in 1945, he held a variety of positions within the military government.  Once Kissinger was discharged from the military, he attended Harvard University, where he earned his B.A. with highest honors in 1950 (and subsequently his M.A. and Ph. D. by 1954). By 1962, Kissinger was working as a professor at Harvard University and consulting closely with the Council on Foreign Relations and Governor Nelson Rockefeller. His resultant body of work was published in a book , Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy. This book helped establish his reputation as a foreign policy scholar.\u00a0 In his book, he introduced the idea that America's success abroad depended not just on its military strength, but also on its ability to recognize and respond to aggression.  When Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968, Kissinger was brought into the administration as National Security Advisor.\u00a0 Later he was appointed to be Secretary of State, a term he held through both the Nixon and Ford administrations. During his term as Secretary of State, Kissinger played a major, albeit secretive, role in diplomatic relations. His secret trip to Beijing in July 1971 prepared the way for Nixon's visit to China in February 1972 which has been credited with opening frozen relations with the People's Republic of China.\u00a0 His behind-the-scenes work allowed him to negotiate the Paris agreements of 1973, which ended direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and earned him the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Le Duc Tho, a North Vietnamese peace negotiator.\u00a0  As an admirer of the principles of realpolitik ,   Kissinger was able to coordinate a short term period of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union, leading to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In 1973, he negotiated the end of the Yom Kippur War, which began with Egypt's invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and Syria's invasion of the Golan Heights. Later, with his help, a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel was reached in 1979, after the Camp David meetings\u00a0 brokered by President Jimmy Carter, in 1978.  Kissinger's most controversial act in foreign relations occurred in December 1975 when Kissinger and President Ford met with President Suharto of Indonesia; giving US approval for the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. This invasion led to the massacre of 200,000 Timorese and caused Kissinger's critics to call for his prosecution for what they consider war crimes.\u00a0 They had also called for his prosecution for the secret bombing of Cambodia in 1969 to which he had allegedly given \"go ahead.\" (He has never been charged nor convicted of any offense related to any of his diplomatic actions.)  Kissinger left office  when President Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the 1976 elections. He   later continued to play a minor advisory role in the Reagan and Bush   administrations and participated in policy groups such as the Trilateral Commission.

{"input": "Context: Bog adder's-mouth: Minnesota DNRBog adder's-mouth: Minnesota DNR  Bog adder's-mouth  by Erika Rowe, Minnesota Biological Survey (MBS) Plant Ecologist  Bog adder's-mouth  Malaxis paludosa  Bog adder's-mouth (Malaxis paludosa)  (L.) Sw. Due to its rarity and chameleon-like ability to blend into the surrounding vegetation, bog adder's-mouth (Malaxis paludosa (L.) Sw.) has proven to be one of the most elusive species of orchid native to Minnesota. The orchid's small stature and greenish color make it easy to overlook among the mossy hummocks within the swamps where it typically grows. Often, the only sign of its presence is the delicate inflorescence rising a scant 5-10cm above the moss. Populations also tend to be very small, often less than 10 plants at a site and rarely more than 20. This elusiveness has often earned bog adder's-mouth the reputation of being one of the rarest orchids in North America.  Prior to 2005, the number of known populations in Minnesota amounted to only a handful distributed across four northern counties. The orchid was unknown in North America until 1904 when H. L. Lyon collected the first specimen in Otter Tail County somewhere near New York Mills. The next record wouldn't occur until 1915 in Clearwater County, followed by discoveries in 1924 and 1927 (also in Clearwater County), and in Hubbard County in 1934. Following this period of initial discovery no new populations were found until 1981, this time in Beltrami County. The last documented occurrence was in 2000, also in Beltrami County. Beyond Minnesota, the only state within the contiguous U.S. to have any documented populations, this circumboreal species has been found in scattered locations in Alaska and Canada, and in Eurasia where it is considered less rare.  The pseudobulb of bog adder's-mouth  While conducting vegetation and rare plant surveys in Becker County during the field season of 2005, Michael Lee, an MBS plant ecologist also working in west-central Minnesota, and I identified five new locations with populations of bog adder's-mouth. During our 2006 field season, four additional locations in Becker County and two in Hubbard County were found (one of the Hubbard County populations was discovered by MCBS Plant Ecologist Tim Whitfeld). These new sites have extended the known range of bog adder's-mouth and increased the documented records to 17 locations in Minnesota; however, three of the historic populations have not been relocated.  All known locations of bog adder's-mouth in Minnesota occur in rich conifer swamps dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) with occasional white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), tamarack (Larix laricina), or balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Typically the shrub layer is fairly open with only minor amounts of dwarf alder (Rhamnus alnifolia), red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea), speckled alder (Alnus incana), or bog birch (Betula glandulifera). The orchid has usually been observed growing in semi-shaded areas \"perched\" in low hummocks of Sphagnum and feathermosses, such as Pleurozium schreberi and Thuidium delicatulum, appearing as if not rooted at all. Other associated herbaceous plants often include: small round-leaved orchis (Amerorchis rotundifolia), goldthread (Coptis trifolia), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), green adder's-mouth (Malaxis unifolia), naked miterwort (Mitella nuda), one-flowered pyrola (Moneses uniflora), small northern bog orchid (Platanthera obtusata), three-leaved false Solomon's seal (Smilacina trifolia), small cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos), creeping snowberry (Gaultheria hispidula), dwarf raspberry (Rubus pubescens), and sedges Carex leptalea, C. disperma, and C. paupercula.  Flowering begins around mid-July and lasts through the end of August, producing 10 to 29 very small, greenish-yellow flowers that have a faint blue-green striped lip. These flowers twist 360\u00b0 so that the lip, or labellum, is uppermost of the perianth parts, as it would be if the flowers were not | Question: An Adder's Mouth is what type of plant?", "truth": ["orchid", "orchids"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2216", "mistake": "orchid", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

A:  Quick Answer  According to the Moreveg website, the oldest known vegetable is the pea, because it has been found in Stone Age settlements over 8,000 years old. Vegetables have been heavily cultivated by humans, and the vegetables eaten in modern times differ greatly from their predecessors. Ancient man also ate plants that modern man would not usually consider vegetables, like ferns and cattails.  Full Answer  Slate reports that kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and kohlrabi were all cultivated from the same prehistoric plant between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. \"Wild carrots may predate human agriculture, but they\u2019re unpalatable and look nothing like the cultivated variety.\" The orange carrot known in modern times did not exist until the 17th century.  In contrast, many modern fruits have ancient counterparts. Olives, plums and pears were found in northern Israel from the Paleolithic era. Dates were found in the teeth of a 40,000-year-old Neanderthal. Grapes were found in northeastern Tennessee that appear to be 7 million years old. According to Slate, \"Apple trees blanketed Kazakhstan 30,000 years ago, oranges were common in China, and wild berries grew in Europe.\" The fruit available has evolved less drastically than vegetables, but has still been modified somewhat. \"Selection by humans has made them larger and sweeter, and may have caused other chemical changes.\"  Tollund ManTollund Man is a naturally mummified corpse of a man who lived during the 4th century BC, during the period characterised in Scandinavia as the Pre-Roman Iron Age.  He was found in 1950 on the Jutland Peninsula in Denmark, buried in a peat bog which preserved his body. Such a find is known as a bog body.  The man's physical features were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim. Twelve years before Tollund Man's discovery, another bog body, Elling Woman, had been discovered in the same bog.  Ancient bog bodies have been found in England and Ireland as well.  Discovery  On 6 May 1950,  brothers Viggo and Emil H\u00f8jgaard from the small village of Tollund were cutting peat in the Bj\u00e6ldskovdal peat bog, 12 km west of Silkeborg, Denmark.  As they worked one of their wives, who was helping to load the peat on a carriage, noticed a corpse in the peat layer. It appeared so fresh that the workers believed they had discovered a recent murder victim. After much deliberation, the woman notified the police in Silkeborg. The find was reported to the police on Tuesday 8 May 1950. They were baffled by the condition of the body and, in an attempt to identify the time of death, they brought in archaeology professor P. V. Glob.  Upon initial examination, Glob suggested that the body was over 2,000 years old and most likely the victim of a ritual sacrifice.  The Tollund Man lay 50 m away from firm ground, buried under approximately 2 m of peat, his body arranged in a foetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap made of sheepskin and wool, fastened securely under his chin by a hide thong. There was a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, the corpse had a noose made of plaited animal hide drawn tight around the neck and trailing down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1\u00a0mm length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting that he had not shaved on the day of his death.

Answer:  I want someone to double check my answer  Describe your changes (optional) 200  Cancel  A helium ion would have an atomic number of 2.  Explanation:  The atomic number does not change when an atom becomes an ion. This is because the atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus, and an ion is formed when an atom gains or loses electrons, which are located in the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus. So a helium ion would have an atomic number of 2, which is the atomic number for helium.  Was this helpful? Let the contributor know!

Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer.

When perhaps, like Mrs Fitzherbert, she may actually have been a royal wife? The British Royal Family has been much in the news recently, with the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton having just taken place at Westminster Abbey, but members of our Royal Family have throughout history found themselves the centre of attention, written about in newspapers and pamphlets and even finding themselves in the centre of a scandal. One royal who was no stranger to scandal was George, Prince of Wales, the son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, who went on to become Prince Regent and then King George IV. Known to his friends as \u2018Prinny\u2019, Prince George led a decadent life at the head of a group of beaus and dandies known as the Carlton House Set, spending his days gambling, drinking, decorating his houses and running up a huge amount of debt. When he was a young man, George was handsome and a great favourite with the ladies, but as he grew older the ravages of his lifestyle caused him to become bloated and pile on the weight, prompting Beau Brummell to utter his famous caustic remark \u2018Alvanley, who\u2019s your fat friend?\u2019\u00a0 Prince George also enjoyed an extensive and varied love life and had many mistresses throughout his life, but perhaps he ever only truly loved one of them?  Mrs Fitzherbert  The lady in question is known to history as Mrs Fitzherbert, although she was born Maria Ann Smythe on 26th July 1756.\u00a0 She was the eldest child of William Smythe and Mary Ann Errington, who were Roman Catholics and well-connected with the British aristocracy, as her mother was a half-sister of the Earl of Sefton. She was sent to Paris for her education, but was married at the age of 18 to Edward Weld, a wealthy Catholic landowner who was 16 years her senior. Unfortunately for the young Maria, her new husband was thrown from a horse only three months after their wedding, without having yet made a new will. This left the young widow in dire financial straits and in desperate need of a new husband to support her, so three years later she wed another older man, Thomas Fitzherbert of Swynnerton in Staffordshire. This time she was ten years younger than her spouse, and the couple had one son who tragically died very young. She was widowed again on 7th May 1781, but this time she was more fortunate in the inheritance stakes as she gained a smart house in Park Street, Mayfair and a healthy annual income.  When she came out of mourning, Mrs Fitzherbert was sponsored into the glittering whirl of London Society by her uncle Lord Sefton and her half-brother Henry Errington. She was now a very eligible young widow, and probably had many suitors. But in the spring of 1784 she was introduced to the very cream of this Society, when Maria Fitzherbert caught the | Question: Mrs Maria Fitzherbert was the wife of which British monarch?", "truth": ["george iv"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2689", "mistake": "George IV", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Today, it is considered to be a classic of French literature, though it is overshadowed by its many subsequent adaptations.The novel was translated into English in 1911. It has since been adapted many times into film and stage productions, the most notable of which were the 1925 film depiction , 2004 film depiction and Andrew Lloyd Webber 's 1986 musical .

Contents  Christine Daae's mother died when she was very young. She and her father, a famous fiddler, traveled all over Sweden playing folk and religious music.  Angel of Music  {{ Her father was known to be the best wedding fiddler in the land. During Christine's childhood, her father told many stories and a character known as The Angel of Music figured heavily in all of them, especially one about a girl he called Little Lotte, who was able to hear the Angel of Music. When Christine meets Raoul, he also enjoys her father's many stories.  Later, when Father Daae is dying--probably of tuberculosis--he tells Christine that when he dies he will send the Angel of Music to her. Christine grieves for her father endlessly. She lives with an elderly woman whose now deceased husband had been her father's benefactor. The woman, known as \"Mamma Valerius\" sends Christine to the conservatory, but Christine's singing is not what it once was. Her sorrow and loneliness make it impossible for her to reach her true potential.  Christine is eventually given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera. Not long after she arrives there, she begins hearing a voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes it must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her \"a little bit of heaven's music.\" The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a disfigured genius who was on the construction crew when the Opera was built and who secretly built into the cellars a home for himself. He is the Opera ghost (Fantome in French can be translated as both \"ghost\" and \"phantom\") who has been exhorting money from Opera management for many years. Unknown to Christine, at least at first, he has fallen in love with her.  With the help of the Voice, Christine triumphs at the gala on the night of the old managers' retirement. Her old childhood friend Raoul hears her and remembers his love for her. After the gala, Erik takes Christine to live in his home in the cellars, but after two weeks, when Christine requests release, he agrees, but only if she wears his ring and is faithful to him. Christine is, for a time, unable to decide between Erik and Raoul and both suitors become increasingly jealous. Up in the rafters of the Opera, Christine tells Raoul of Erik taking her to the cellars. Raoul promises to take Christine away where Erik can never find her the following day, to which Christine agrees, but she pities Erik and will not go until she has sung for him one last time.

{"input": "Context: The Three Sisters, Anton Chekhov - eNotes.comThe Three Sisters Essay - The Three Sisters, Anton Chekhov - eNotes.com  The Three Sisters Essay - The Three Sisters, Anton Chekhov  link Link  The Three Sisters Anton Chekhov  The following entry presents criticism on Chekhov's Tri sestry (1901; The Three Sisters). See also Anton Chekhov Short Story Criticism, Anton Chekhov Drama Criticism, Gooseberries Criticism, and The Seagull Criticism.  Considered to be one of Chekhov's most moving and sensitive dramas, The Three Sisters reflects the pervasive pessimism of its era. The play tells the story of the three Prozorov sisters who despise their small-town life in Russia. Though the women pine for the glamour of Moscow where they previously lived, they refuse to do anything to change their unhappy lives. Chekhov used the Prozorov family as an analogy for the futility and despair experienced by Russians of that era. Since its initial production, The Three Sisters has been widely acclaimed for its subtle artistry and insight.  Plot and Major Characters  The Three Sisters examines the lives of the Prozorovs, a Russian family who live in a provincial garrison town far from Moscow. The three sisters, Masha, Olga, and Irina, all long to return to Moscow and spend their time bemoaning their humdrum lives. As the male head of the family after their father dies, their brother Andrey is thought to be their only hope for a secure future. But he spoils both his future and his sisters' by marrying Natasha, a greedy and vulgar woman who eventually forces the sisters to leave their own home. Rather than studying, Andrey spends his time gambling, while Masha, Irina, and Olga fail at jobs, marriage, and romance. At the end, as dreams are uniformly shattered, each sister ponders why life has brought them so much pain.  Major Themes  The Three Sisters, like Chekhov's plays of his later period, intertwines the mundane and the tragic. Chekhov focuses on the women's inability to be happy and their brother's staunch rejection of any promise in his life. But Chekhov is not above the use of humor to poke fun at the stubborn backwardness of his characters. The Three Sisters uses a subtle form of indirect action that, for Chekhov, mirrored real life. If reality is paced in a certain fashion, Chekhov reasoned, his plays should reflect that reality.  Critical Reception  In 1901 the Moscow Art Theater presented The Three Sisters. Early critics, especially Russian commentators, interpreted the play as yet another chapter in the ongoing saga of Russian landowners' demise. Other criticism focused on a perceived lack of storyline and dramatic conflict in the work. Scholars have consistently pointed to the careful construction of the play. While The Three Sisters may appear static in print, it is complicated to perform. Because The Three Sisters, like Chekhov's other dramas, called for a performance style that was less grandiose and more given to inflection and allusion, a flamboyant production could easily obscure the intention of Chekhov's work. Fortunately, the noted director Konstantin Stanislavski, who directed Three Sisters at the Moscow Art Theater, developed a psychological, introspective dramatic style appropriate to Chekhov's plays. In later years The Three Sister's depiction of futility has caused Chekhov to be considered a precursor to dramatists of the Theater of the Absurd.

(Djansezian/Getty)  DAILY NEWS WEST COAST BUREAU CHIEF  Monday, April 13, 2009, 6:15 PM  LOS ANGELES - Famed Record producer Phil Spector was convicted of second-degree murder Monday for the shooting death of B-movie actress Lana Clarkson six years ago.  The judge ordered him to face the music immediately, citing his \"history of violence\" as he shipped the wild-eyed, big-haired Spector off to jail.  Spector's young, blond wife broke down in tears while Clarkson's mom, Donna, hugged Deputy District Attorney Alan Jackson .  A Bronx native who pioneered the \"Wall of Sound\" style of early 1960s rock 'n' roll and produced records for the Beatles , the Ramones and The Righteous Brothers , Spector faces a minimum of 18 years for the Feb. 3, 2003, slaying.  Spector, 69, fired a bullet in the mouth of Clarkson, 40, as she sat in the foyer of his castlelike mansion in Alhambra, Calif. His conviction came after a first trial in 2007 ended with a hung jury whose majority favored conviction.  The first jury deliberated for about 44 hours while the retrial jurors spent about 30 hours.  At both trials, which each lasted about six months, Spector's lawyers tried to convince jurors that Clarkson was despondent over a failed acting career and pointed the gun at her own face before pulling the trigger.  Prosecutors argued that the reclusive Spector murdered Clarkson when the blond beauty tried to flee his home before he was ready to say goodbye.  \"I feel relief for the family,\" Jackson said after the verdict. \"Today is when the Clarkson family gets their justice.\"  The Clarkson family is \"pleased with the verdict\" and that the jury \"rejected the distortion and trashing of Lana Clarkson's life,\" family spokesman John Taylor said.  But \"there's no joy here today,\" he said, standing next to Donna Clarkson . \"It's a tragedy.\"  Jackson called several former female acquaintances to testify that Spector had threatened them with guns in alcohol-fueled incidents eerily similar to the night Clarkson died.  Possibly the most damning evidence came from Spector's former chauffeur Adriano De Souza , who told jurors that Spector emerged from the mansion the night of Clarkson's death and said, \"I think I killed somebody\" as he held a bloody gun.

Viewers may have recognized Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, the creamy-voiced soprano whose radiant beauty graced the world's top opera houses from the 1970s through '90s. But far fewer probably know about Dame Nellie Melba, the Australian-born superstar Te Kanawa portrayed in the episode.  It's a voice of ethereal purity with perhaps the only perfect trill I've ever heard.  Tim Page  Even some opera buffs may have forgotten Melba. But in her day she was colossal, an artist who dominated European and American music for a period, one so adored that Melba toast and Peach Melba were created in her name by famed chef Auguste Escoffier.  Even today, Melba's recorded voice rings clearly as a favorite of Tim Page , Pulitzer winner for criticism and professor of music and journalism at USC.  \"There's something sort of unreal about it,\" Page says. \"It's a voice of ethereal purity with perhaps the only perfect trill I've ever heard.\" Another celebrated Melba attribute is accuracy: \"She hit things absolutely on pitch,\" he continues. \"You never hear Melba sliding into a note. Her tone was as reliable as a keyed instrument. She's just dead on.\"  Melba, whose real name was Helen Porter Mitchell, was born in 1861 near Melbourne to a Scottish settler who landed in Australia during the gold rush and found a musical wife. They provided lessons for their daughter whose voice, in her early 20s, was, according to an Australian music critic, \"like one out of ten thousand.\"  Article continues after sponsorship  YouTube  A bad marriage did not stop her from heading to Europe to seek her fortune in opera. After study in Paris with the famous teacher Mathilde Marchesi, Nellie Melba (her new name a riff off Helen and Melbourne) made her official debut in Brussels in 1887 as Gilda in Verdi 's Rigoletto. Europe's great opera houses were soon clamoring for her, and she quickly became one of the most recognizable names in music.  Melba made her Met debut in New York in 1893 as Lucia di Lammermoor. Henry Krehbiel, writing for the New York Tribune, characterized her as the \"finest exemplar heard on the local stage\" in the past 10 years, describing her voice as \"charmingly fresh and exquisitely beautiful.\"  Not everyone loved Melba as much. Gustav Mahler , after hearing her sing in La Traviata, said he'd prefer a good clarinetist instead. She was also accused of being dramatically neutral. Sir Thomas Beecham's famous line was that she was \"uninterestingly perfect, and perfectly uninteresting.\"  \"The idea that she was a cold singer strikes me as an anomaly, but she was an austere singer,\" Page says. \"She never tears passion to tatters.

''Breakfast at Tiffany's' star Audrey Hepburn  'Breakfast at Tiffany's Live' is set to debut at the Royal Albert Hall in London.  The world premiere live-in-concert screening will see the iconic movie - starring Audrey Hepburn - shown in full, while it is accompanied by Henry Mancini's Oscar-winning score performed by an orchestra and a choir.  Looking forward to the production, Lucy Noble, the Director of Events at the Royal Albert Hall, said: \"This iconic film is famous for many things: Audrey Hepburn 's peerless sense of style, the headily romantic atmosphere, an exceptional cat, and - of course - Henry Mancini's timeless score, including the classic song 'Moon River'.  \"This unique event will bring the music centre-stage, quite literally, as it is performed live and in full by an orchestra and choir.  \"This is 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' as it has never been seen - or heard - before, so grab a pastry and a 'huckleberry friend' and head for the Royal Albert Hall in June.\"  The 1961 comedy-drama is often cited as one of the greatest movies ever made and the event has been created to celebrate Mancini's score at one of the world's most historic venues.  Moon River\"Moon River\" is a song composed by Henry Mancini with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. It received an Academy Award for Best Original Song for its performance by Audrey Hepburn in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961).  It also won Mancini the 1962 Grammy Award for Record of the Year and won Mancini and Mercer the Grammy Award for Song of the Year.  The song has been covered by many other artists.  It became the theme song for Andy Williams, who first recorded it in 1961 and performed it at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1962. He sang the first eight bars of the song at the beginning of each episode of his eponymous television show and named his production company and venue in Branson, Missouri after it. His autobiography is called \"Moon River\" and Me. Williams' version was never released as a single, but it charted as an LP track that he recorded for Columbia on a hit album of 1962. Cadence Records' president Archie Bleyer disliked Williams' version, as Bleyer believed it had little or no appeal to teenagers.  Forty years later in 2002, a 74-year-old Williams sang the song at the conclusion of the live telecast of the NBC 75th Anniversary Special to a standing ovation.   The song's success was responsible for relaunching Mercer's career as a songwriter, which had stalled in the mid-1950s because rock and roll had replaced jazz standards as the popular music of the time. The song's popularity is such that it has been used as a test sample in a study on people's memories of popular songs.   Comments about the lyrics have noted that they are particularly reminiscent of Mercer's youth in the Southern United States and his longing to expand his horizons. Robert Wright wrote in The Atlantic Monthly, \"This is a love sung to wanderlust. Or a romantic song in which the romantic partner is the idea of romance.\"  An inlet near Savannah, Georgia, Johnny Mercer's hometown, was named Moon River in honor of him and this song.  Versions  Original  Mercer and Mancini wrote the song for Audrey Hepburn to fit her vocal range. The lyrics, written by Mercer, are reminiscent of his childhood in Savannah, Georgia, including its waterways. As a child, he had picked huckleberries in summer, and connected them with a carefree childhood and Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.Cryer, Max.

{"input": "Context: Which scientist discovered neutrons? | Reference.comWhich scientist discovered neutrons? | Reference.com  Which scientist discovered neutrons?  A:  Quick Answer  James Chadwick discovered neutrons in 1932, PBS states. Neutrons are the particles in an atom's nucleus that have mass but no charge. Chadwick proved their existence by tracking particle radiation.  Full Answer  In the early 20th century, scientists were puzzled by the mass of atoms because the mass was consistently greater than the combined mass of the electrons and protons in the atom. Several theories were proposed to explain this discrepancy. Some thought that it was possibly due to more protons and electrons in the nucleus with charges that cancelled each other out to make them less apparent. Others proposed a possible particle with no charge. Chadwick undertook experiments tracking particle radiation from certain atoms while watching for the existence of a neutrally charged particle. His experiments were successful and proved the existence of the neutron.  This Month in Physics History - American Physical SocietyThis Month in Physics History  This Month in Physics History  May 1932: Chadwick reports the discovery of the neutron  AIP Emilio Segre Visual Archives  James Chadwick  By 1920, physicists knew that most of the mass of the atom was located in a nucleus at its center, and that this central core contained protons. In May 1932 James Chadwick announced that the core also contained a new uncharged particle, which he called the neutron. \u00a0  Chadwick was born in1891 in Manchester, England. He was a shy child from a working class family, but his talents caught his teachers\u2019 attention, and he was sent to study physics at the University of Manchester, where he worked with Ernest Rutherford on various radioactivity studies.  In 1914, Chadwick decided to travel to Germany to study with Hans Geiger. Unfortunately, not long after he arrived, WWI broke out and Chadwick ended up spending the next four years in a prison camp there. This did not entirely stop his scientific studies. To keep from being bored, he and some fellow prisoners formed a science club, lectured to each other, and managed to convince the guards to let them set up a small lab. Though many chemicals were hard to get hold of, Chadwick even found a type of radioactive toothpaste that was on the market in Germany at the time, and managed to persuade the guards to supply him with it. Using some tin foil and wood he built an electroscope and did some simple experiments. \u00a0  After the war, Chadwick returned to England, where he finished his PhD in Cambridge in 1921 with Rutherford, who was then Director of Cambridge University\u2019s Cavendish laboratory. Chadwick was able to continue to work on radioactivity, now with more sophisticated apparatus than tin foil and toothpaste. In 1923, Chadwick was appointed assistant director of Cavendish Laboratory.  Rutherford had discovered the atomic nucleus in 1911, and had observed the proton in 1919. However, it seemed there must be something in the nucleus in addition to protons. For instance, helium was known to have an atomic number of 2 but a mass number of 4. Some scientists thought there were additional protons in the nucleus, along with an equal number of electrons to cancel out the additional charge. In 1920, Rutherford proposed that an electron and a proton could actually combine to form a new, neutral particle, but there was no real evidence for this, and the proposed neutral particle would be difficult to detect.  Chadwick went on to work on other projects, but kept thinking about the problem. Around 1930, several researchers, including German physicist Walter Bothe and his student Becker had begun bombarding beryllium with alpha particles from a polonium source and studying the radiation emitted by the beryllium as a result. Some scientists thought this highly penetrating radiation emitted by the beryllium consisted of high energy photons. Chadwick had noticed some odd features of this radiation, and began to think it might instead consist of neutral particles such as those Rutherford had proposed.  One experiment in particular caught his attention: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie had studied the then-unidentified radiation from beryllium as it hit a paraffin wax target. They found that this radiation knocked loose protons from hydrogen | Question: Which scientist discovered the Neutron in 1934?", "truth": ["james chadwick"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6879", "mistake": "James Chadwick", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Peter Bartok and Nelson O. Dellamaggiore)  B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k was born in Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s, Hungary, now S\u00eennicolau Mare, Romania, on March 25, 1881, and died in New York City on September 26, 1945. He composed his ballet score The Wooden Prince between April 1914 and the spring of 1916 and carried out the orchestration in 1916-17, completing it in January of the latter year. The ballet was premiered May 12, 1917, at the Budapest Opera, with Egisto Tango conducting. Bart\u00f3k undertook a revision of his score in 1932, at which point he introduced numerous cuts as well as new transitions to points of continuation. The San Francisco Symphony played the complete score of The Wooden Prince in February 2005 with David Zinman conducting; these are the first SFS performances of the Suite. The score calls for a large orchestra of four flutes (third and fourth doubling piccolos), four oboes (third and fourth doubling English horns), alto and tenor saxophones (the latter doubling baritone saxophone), four clarinets (third doubling E-flat clarinet, fourth doubling bass clarinet), four bassoons (third and fourth doubling contrabassoons), four horns, four trumpets, two cornets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, glockenspiel, xylophone, triangle, castanets, cymbals, snare drum, bass drum, tam-tam, celesta, two harps, and strings. Performance time: about twenty-five minutes.  Among Bart\u00f3k\u2019s considerable output, we find only three works for the stage, each pertaining to a distinct genre and all three composed in chronological proximity during the 1910s: the opera Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, the ballet The Wooden Prince, and the pantomime The Miraculous Mandarin. Something elemental binds these works together. They document the composer\u2019s exploration of an underlying theme, how human interactions play out in the darkest recesses of intimacy.  Bart\u00f3k was at heart a humanist but he was not an optimist, and Bluebeard\u2019s Castle and The Miraculous Mandarin are somber to the point of anguish. The Wooden Prince offers a contrasting moment of hopefulness in this landscape of emotional desolation. Bart\u00f3k\u2019s colleague Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly recognized this when he observed that \u201cthe constructive energy of the music [of Bluebeard\u2019s Castle] becomes even more evident if we hear The Wooden Prince immediately afterwards. The playful mobile Allegro of the ballet serves to balance the desolate Adagio of the opera. The two works fit together like two movements of a huge symphony.\u201d  The hopefulness of The Wooden Prince was hard won. Bart\u00f3k was thirty when he completed Bluebeard\u2019s Castle. As a composer, his reputation was advancing only haltingly, but he had great hope that his opera might be a breakthrough. The libretto was prepared by B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs, a Symbolist poet, novelist, and dramatist who shared Bart\u00f3k\u2019s aspiration to create a stage work that was at once thoroughly modern and thoroughly Hungarian. Hopes for the piece came to naught when Bart\u00f3k submitted it to a national competition for one-act operas, only to have it deemed unplayable by the jury, a judgment echoed by the decision-makers at the Budapest Opera.  Bluebeard\u2019s Castle therefore went unproduced, and Bart\u00f3k, who was disposed towards bitterness, essentially withdrew from the world of composition and performance, instead retreating into the wilds to make ethnomusicological recordings. During the years of World War I he again began to compose. The most imposing of his creations to emerge from this period was The Wooden Prince.  Despite its resistance to Bluebeard\u2019s Castle, the Budapest Opera had approached Bart\u00f3k in March 1913 to suggest that he consider writing a ballet. Serge Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes had visited Budapest in 1912, and that company\u2019s performances of avant-garde works, including Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird, had been received with great enthusiasm\u2014an enthusiasm that Bart\u00f3k had not shared, since he was | Question: \"The opera \"\"Duke Bluebeard's Castle\"\" and the ballet \"\"The Wooden Prince\"\" are the works of which composer?\" ?", "truth": ["b\u00e9la viktor j\u00e1nos bart\u00f3k", "bart\u00f3k", "b\u00e9la bart\u00f3k"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1848", "mistake": "B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Orangutans have an enormous arm span. A male may stretch his arms some 7 feet (2 meters) from fingertip to fingertip\u2014a reach considerably longer than his standing height of about 5 feet (1.5 meters). When orangutans do stand, their hands nearly touch the ground.  Orangutans' arms are well suited to their lifestyle because they spend much of their time (some 90 percent) in the trees of their tropical rain forest home. They even sleep aloft in nests of leafy branches. They use large leaves as umbrellas and shelters to protect themselves from the common rains.  These cerebral primates forage for food during daylight hours. Most of their diet consists of fruit and leaves gathered from rain forest trees. They also eat bark, insects and, on rare occasions, meat.  Orangutans are more solitary than other apes. Males are loners. As they move through the forest they make plenty of rumbling, howling calls to ensure that they stay out of each other's way. The \"long call\" can be heard 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) away.  Mothers and their young, however, share a strong bond. Infants will stay with their mothers for some six or seven years until they develop the skills to survive on their own. Female orangutans give birth only once every eight years\u2014the longest time period of any animal. The animals are long-lived and have survived as long as 60 years in captivity.  Because orangutans live in only a few places, and because they are so dependent upon trees, they are particularly susceptible to logging in these areas. Unfortunately, deforestation and other human activities, such as hunting, have placed the orangutan in danger of extinction.

A:  Quick Answer  The official language of Barbados is English. Barbadians also speak an English-based Creole language called Bajan that uses both West African and English terms and grammar.  Full Answer  Barbadians use English for all government, communicative and administrative purposes through the island, but in daily life, people tend to use Bajan. Ethnologue estimates that Barbados has around 13,000 people who use English as their main language and 256,000 people who use Bajan as their main language. There is a small Amerindian population, but they are linguistically assimilated into the larger community.

The colorful dialect heard on Barbados is a language all its own  Photo credit: \u00a9 Roger Mcclean | Dreamstime.com  \u00a0  Bajan is a colorful and expressive dialect that is enjoyable to listen to, and many visitors consider it an essential element of a holiday in Barbados.  The official language of Barbados is English, but in informal settings, you will often hear Bajan, which is an English-based Barbadian Creole. A dialect of the language that linguists classify as broken English, Bajan uses English words with African syntax, and speakers have an accent best described as a combination of African and British.  The unusual sentence structure and fast-paced speech that is common among natives can make Bajan language hard to understand to many English speakers, even if they're familiar with the words being used. Barbadians also have many colorful turns of phrase that you may not be familiar with. For example, \"Pompasettin'\" means that someone is showing off, and \"Wukkin' up\" is a gyrating, energetic dance. One of Barbados' more well known proverbs is \"Wuh sweeten goat mouth does bun e tail,\" which means what seems sweet and good at first can have negative or painful consequences.  When in Barbados, it is important to remember that Bajans do know English, and you can speak to them just as you would any other native speaker. They will understand you. If you attempt to imitate their accent or speak slowly so that they can understand you, the gesture may be construed as insulting. Locals also tend to be very understanding of the differences between traditional English language and Bajan dialect, and will be happy to repeat themselves if you have trouble understanding them the first time around.  \u00a0  Barbados - Speaking the Language | ExpatFocus.comBarbados - Speaking the Language | ExpatFocus.com  Barbados  \u00b1  JOIN OUR NEWSLETTER  Get expat health and financial news, interesting expat articles, social media recommendations and more in your inbox each month - free!

Her worst duty toward him is to see to it that he washes and puts on clean clothes, so that he will look respectable when Aunt Polly takes the children to Sunday school.  When a new family moves into town, Tom sees a pretty, blue-eyed girl with lacy pantalettes.

There he met actress Emma Thompson and his future partner in comedy, Stephen Fry. Laurie and Fry became familiar faces on British television in the 1980s and \u201990s , appearing in Rowan Atkinson \u2018s Blackadder series, as well as A Bit of Fry & Laurie and Jeeves and Wooster (with Laurie as Bertie Wooster). On film, Hugh Laurie appeared with Thompson in Peter\u2019s Friends (1992) and Ang Lee \u2018s version of Jane Austen \u2018s Sense and Sensibility (1995, also with Kate Winslet ). Once in Hollywood, Laurie became familiar to filmgoers for his roles in children\u2019s movies, especially the live-action version of 101 Dalmations (1996, starring Glenn Close ) and 1999\u2019s Stuart Little and its sequels (opposite Geena Davis ). In 2004 he won the lead role in the medical series House\u00a0(which also starred\u00a0 Lisa Edelstein ). \u00a0Laurie played Dr. Gregory House, a cranky skeptic with a limp and a sour disposition who was nonetheless a brilliant diagnostician. \u00a0(House\u2019s signature comment: \u201cEverybody lies.\u201d) The role brought Laurie six Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe wins (2006 and 2007).

The child of an unknown man and Blythe House , a housewife who was married to a Marine pilot John House . At the same time that John was overseas, Blythe was also having an affair with Thomas Bell whom House believed was his biological father because they share certain physical characteristics and birthmarks.  As his father served on active duty through most of House's childhood and adolescence, House has lived in a variety of countries, such as Egypt, the Philippines and Japan. As a result, House is able to speak Spanish and Mandarin Chinese, is able to read at least some Hindi and also claims to read Portuguese. Additionally, he has some knowledge of several others. For example, French and Latin phrases several times, but it is unknown how much he knows.  House was obviously a bright child, a mixed blessing as his harshly demanding father and\u00a0enabling mother obviously had high hopes for him. He cultivated a variety of interests, such as chemistry and playing the piano and guitar. However, it appears that his isolation from people his age and his poor relationship with his parents led House to become something of a loner.\u00a0He had no real friends growing up which\u00a0more than likely added on to his anti-social behavior.\u00a0It is intimated that he frequently rebelled against his father and was punished as a result with both intense physical discomfort and emotional isolation.

They come as pilgrims , especially from Russia\u2014up to sixty bus loads a day during the peak season\u2014where Saint Nicholas is revered as patron and a father of Orthodox faith. The beautiful beaches and warm weather along the Mediterranean coast also draw visitors from both Eastern and Western Europe. They may come to Demre as pilgrims, or, out of curiosity, wondering about the origin of Santa Claus, who is called Noel Baba or Father Christmas in Turkey.  Vendors' stalls and shops are jam-packed with a vast array of St. Nicholas icon images offered in stone, weavings, wax, and metal. They are found as medals, bookmarks, plates, figurines, and icons . Rug dealers hawk his image in several sizes and many colors. Icon images greatly outnumber Santa-types, giving silent testimony to the numbers of Christian, particularly Orthodox, pilgrims.  Saint Nicholas was born in Greco-Roman Lycia , an area now part of modern-day Turkey. During his life, Constantine became Emperor, following Diocletian who had persecuted Christians, including Nicholas. Christianity then flourished, replacing Greek and Roman Pagan deities, becoming the primary religion. However, after the Seljuk Turks' conquest (11th\u201313th centuries) and with the Ottoman Empire 's long reign (14th\u201320th centuries), the dominant religion in this land, evangelized by the Apostle Paul, became Islam. Today, after the expulsion of Greek Christians in 1922, 99.8% * of Turkish people are Muslim, though Turkey is officially a secular state.  In the early 1950s Turks realized that the Bishop of Myra, Saint Nicholas, was none other than the western world's Santa Claus or Father Christmas.\u00a0Just as the good saint had brought pilgrims to Myra, and later to Bari , Italy, it was hoped he would again attract tourists and pilgrims with their lira, euros, and dollars.  Turkey issued a Santa Claus stamp in 1955, drawing further attention to St. Nicholas' relationship to this place. Since 1981 regular events somewhat related to the good saint have been held under the sponsorship of the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Anatalyan governor's office. The first Father Christmas Symposium, held in 1983, has become an annual event, lasting about a week over the 6th of December, St. Nicholas Day . Religious and scientific people come from many countries for the Activities for World Peace with Santa Claus, including the Santa Claus Peace Award. This led to the establishment in 1991 of the Santa Claus Foundation to promote peace, friendship and brotherhood.  For many years an Orthodox liturgy was held in the Church of St. Nicholas on the 6th of December, St. Nicholas Day. This was the only service held in the church and it was not allowed from 2002-2006.

{"input": "Context: The Brady Bunch - worldwizzy.comThe Brady Bunch  The Brady Bunch  The Brady Bunch is an American television situation comedy , based around a large blended family . The show originally aired from 1969 to 1974 on the ABC network, and was subsequently syndicated across the world.  Contents  [ edit ] Origins  Sherwood Schwartz , creator of the series, conceived the idea for the series after  reading an article that a growing share of the marriages in the United States involved children from a previous marriage. Despite the similarities between the series and the 1968 theatrical release Yours, Mine and Ours , starring Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball , the original script for The Brady Bunch (which was titled Yours and Mine at that early stage) predated the script for the film. However, the success of the film was likely a factor in the network ordering the series.  [ edit ] Plot  Mike Brady, a widowed architect with sons Greg, Peter, and Bobby, married Carol Martin (n\u00e9e Tyler), whose daughters were Marcia, Jan, and Cindy. The daughters took the Brady surname. Schwartz wanted Carol to have been a divorc\u00e9e. The network objected to this, but a compromise was reached whereby no mention was made of the circumstances in which Carol's first marriage ended.  The new family, including Mike's housekeeper Alice , moved into a new home designed by Mike. Episodes in the first season chronicled the family learning to adjust to its new circumstances and become a unit, as well as typical childhood problems such as dating, rivalries and family squabbles.  Subtle references to larger societal problems occasionally found their way into the dialogue. In one social-issue episode, season two's \"The Liberation of Marcia Brady,\" Marcia explores the oppression of the Brady women and sets out to prove a girl can do anything a boy can.  Mike did much of his architectural work in an office/design studio within the house, an apparent way of lending some realism to the way in which sitcom dads seem to be almost always at home while nonetheless earning a good living.  The theme song penned by Schwartz quickly communicated to audiences that the Bradys were a blended family though from the second season on scripts tended to deemphasize the fact, with a few exceptions. In the episodes, \"Not So Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Jan's Aunt Jenny,\" mention was made that Mike and Carol had been married for three years. In \"Kelly's Kids,\" the Bradys' adoptions were referenced when their neighbors, the Kellys, adopted three boys of different races.  [ edit ] Original run and subsequent success  The Brady Bunch was not a highly rated program during its primetime run (it never placed in the top 25 in the five years it aired) and was cancelled in 1974. Despite its less than stellar primetime ratings and having won no awards, the show has become a true cultural phenomenon, having lasted in the minds of Americans and in syndication for over 35 years. The series has spawned several sequel series on all three traditional major U.S. networks, two theatrical and three made-for-TV movies, a touring stage show, and countless specials and documentaries on both network and cable TV.  Since its first airing in syndication in September 1975, an episode of the show has been broadcast somewhere in the US and abroad every single day of every single year through at least 2006. It was also shown on ABC in the daytime during the summer months from July 9 , 1973 to August 29 , 1975 . (The only time the show was off television was from August 1974 when the prime time and daytime runs ended until October 1974 when the daytime reruns on ABC resumed in most markets.) When the episodes were repeated in syndication, usually appearing every weekday in late-afternoon and early evening slots so children could watch the episodes when they returned from school, the program became widely popular and achieved iconic status among those who were too young to have seen the series during its prime time run.

During photosynthesis, plants trap light energy with their leaves.  Plants use the energy of the sun to change water and carbon dioxide into a sugar called glucose. Glucose is used by plants for energy and to make other substances like cellulose and starch.  Cellulose is used in building cell walls.

A:  Quick Answer  The green pigment that traps energy from sunlight is called chlorophyll. This pigment is found in special cell organelles called chloroplasts and it is also found in some special anaerobic bacteria called cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts are found only in the cells of the leaves of green plants.  Full Answer  During the daytime, when sunlight falls on green leaves, it traps the solar energy and converts it into simple carbohydrates such as glucose and starch. Thus, it helps to convert solar energy into chemical form.  This process is called photosynthesis and takes place only in green plants. For photosynthesis to take place, carbon dioxide and water vapor are also necessary. Oxygen is given out during the process of photosynthesis.

They are also found in the cells of other organisms that use photosynthesis. Chloroplasts take the energy from the sunlight and use it to make plant food. The food can be used immediately to give cells energy or it can be stored as sugar or starch. If stored, it can be used later when the plant needs to do work, like grow a new branch or make a flower.  Chloroplasts up close  Inside chloroplasts are special stacks of pancake-shaped structures called thylakoids (Greek thylakos = sack or pouch). Thylakoids have an outer membrane that surrounds an inner area called the lumen. The light-dependent reactions happen inside the thylakoid.  Our cells have mitochondria (Greek mitos = thread, and khondrion = little granule), our energy-producing structures. We don't have any chloroplasts. Plants have both mitochondria and chloroplasts.  Both mitochondria and chloroplasts convert one form of energy into another form that cells can use. How did plants get chloroplasts? Chloroplasts were once free-living bacteria!

A:  Quick Answer  The molten rock below the Earth\u2019s surface is known as magma. Magma is a combination of a molten and semi-molten rock mixture that is extremely hot. Magma is between 1,292 and 2,372 degrees Fahrenheit, or 700 and 1,300 degrees Celsius.  Full Answer  Magma is a dynamic and fluid substance that is capable of creating new landforms. This molten rock starts in the upper part of the mantle and the lower portion of the crust. When magma erupts from a volcano or other vent, the molten rock is referred to as lava. When lava cools on the Earth\u2019s surface and forms a solid structure, it is called igneous rock.  Igneous Rock - The Face of the Earth - GovIgneous Rock: Face of the Earth  Home | Games | Glossary | Bulletin Board | Landforms | Rock Cycle | Processes | SKC Homepage  Igneous Rock  On the earth's surface, there are three types of rocks, metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous.  In northern Canada,  much of the hard rock found is igneous rock. Igneous rock is rock formed by the hardening and  crystallization of molten material that originates deep within the earth.  The word \"igneous\"  comes from the Greek word for fire; some people call igneous rock a fire ball rock. Rocks that  have hardened from magma, the hot liquid beneath the earth's crust, are called igneous rocks.  The inside of the earth is very hot - hot enough to melt rocks. The deeper you get the hotter  it gets. Below the surface, the molten rock is called magma; at the earth's surface it becomes  lava, nothing has changed only the name of the liquid. Igneous rock is made by fire. Small  wonder the magma from which igneous rock is formed can reach temperatures  close to 1200 degrees  Celsius.  As the super hot magma cools, it solidifies to form a rock and that rock is called  igneous rock. When most people think of igneous rock they vision a volcano erupting pumice and  lava. Igneous rocks form directly by crystallization from materials from a magma melt. Igneous  rocks crystalize after the magma reaches the earth's surface.  Igneous rock is divided into 2 groups, extrusive and intrusive. Extrusive rocks form when magma  flows onto the surface of the earth or floor of the ocean through deep cracks or fissures and at  volcanic vents, and then cools and hardens. Intrusive rock results when magma solidifies  beneath the earth's surface in mines and tunnels or at the surface where it has been exposed by  geological uplifting and by erosion. In general, extrusive rocks have a finer grained texture  than intrusive rocks; intrusive rocks vary from thin sheets to huge, irregular masses. Since  magma that forms intrusive rocks solidifies slowly, most intrusive rocks have larger crystals  than extrusive rocks.

{"input": "Context: Pandalus borealisPandalus borealis is a species of caridean shrimp found in cold parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The FAO refers to them as the northern prawn. Other common names include pink shrimp, deepwater prawn, deep-sea prawn, great northern prawn, ' and northern shrimp.  Distribution  P. borealis lives at depths of 20 -, usually on soft muddy bottoms,  in waters with a temperature of 0 -.  The distribution of the nominate subspecies P. b. borealis in the Atlantic ranges from New England, Canada's eastern seaboard (off Newfoundland and Labrador and eastern Baffin Island in Nunavut), southern and eastern Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Norway and the North Sea as far south as the English Channel. In the Pacific, P. b. eous is found from Japan, through the Sea of Okhotsk, across the Bering Strait, and as far south in North America as Washington state.  Physiology  In their 8-year lifespan, males can reach a length of 120 mm, while females can reach 165 mm long.  The shrimp are hermaphroditic. They start out male, but after a year or two, their testicles turn to ovaries and they complete their lives as females.   Commercial fishing  P. borealis is an important food resource, and has been widely fished since the early 1900s in Norway, and later in other countries following Johan Hjort's practical discoveries of how to locate them. In Canada, these shrimp are sold peeled, cooked and frozen in bags in supermarkets, and are consumed as appetizers.  Northern shrimp have a short life, which contributes to a variable stock on a yearly basis. However, the species is not considered overfished due to a large amount reported and a large amount harvested.  In Canada, the annual harvest limit is set to 164,000 tonnes (2008). The Canadian fishery began in the 1980s and expanded in 1990s.  In 2013 the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission determined that stocks of P. borealis were too low and shut down the New England fishery. This was the first cancellation in 35 years.   Uses  Beyond human consumption, shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP), an enzyme used in molecular biology, is obtained from Pandalus borealis, and the species' carapace is a source of chitosan, a versatile chemical used for such different applications as treating bleeding wounds, filtering wine or improving the soil in organic farming.

Still, they had a massive 69 UK hit singles, 35 as 'The Shadows' plus 34 as 'Cliff Richard and The Shadows'. That's not bad you know? More than The Black Eyed Peas will ever enjoy, at any rate. Rather random comparison I know, but there is meaning in the madness. This debut album of theirs charted in only two countries, according to my incomplete records, hitting number one in the UK and number three in France, of all places. The album was recorded at the famous Abbey Road studios, although it was yet to be famous. The Beatles made it famous, but even the Beatles owed a stylistic debt to The Shadows, if nothing else. True, George Harrison was no Hank Marvin but the idea of a fully-formed, independant British group started with The Shadows, at least, as far as popular public concensus is concerned. I'm reviewing 'Cliff Sings' at the same time as writing this, listening to both together. When Cliff had the orchestra backing him and not The Shadows he sounded a hell of a lot less interesting. There is also a tie-in with Joe Meek, a huge favourite of mine. The Shadows eventually became a sanitised, acceptable version of what Joe Meek was trying to do with many of his instrumental groups, but that's to take nothing away from The Shadows who were at this stage a pretty exciting bunch. Sure, they may have been no Fabulous Flee-Rekkers, but Fabulous Flee-Rekkers only had one hit, The Shadows had 69. This is the only Shadows album by the way that features the original Shadows line up, Harris resigned in 1962. Ah, Jet Harris MBE, I thank you. In 1998 he was awarded a Fender Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in popularising the bass guitar in Britain, his brief tenure with The Shadows went on to influence many bass players during the Sixties and right through the to the Seventies. That he ended up as a brick-layer after having several hits with (also former shadow) Tony Meehan is something of a disgrace.  Ah, I want to throw this in. A full three years before The Beatles debut LP wrote in history forever than British groups previously relied on American songs, this album features 7 original compositions, of which 'Shadoogie' at least is utterly superb and really showcases the talents of all involved. But ah, Jet Harris. Based on this album alone you could say he was amongst the greatest of all British bass players, alongside Chris Squire and Peter Hook, in my own private reckonning. Well, not private any more, but listen to the guy on 'Nivram' and try to tell me he wasn't utterly superb - what a feeling! 'See You In My Drums' proves what great musicians these guys were - were 'Yes' ever influenced by The Shadows, does anybody know? Great Piano on 'Stand Up And Say That' and I do admit something of a guilty pleasure as far as Sixties instrumental music goes. Well, British rather than American, never could quite fall in love with 'The Ventures' in quite the same way. A truly electric and exciting 'Gonzales' continue to ensure the album thrills and then 'Find Me A Golden Street' is utterly wonderful atmospherics. 'My Resitance Is Low' features several Joe Meek effects and it's a shame he never got to work with the group. Still, this a thoroughly absorbing album all should hear.

It was released in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2010 as the lead single from their second studio album, Outta This World.  Background  Its lyrics sample \"The Sound of Music\", composed by Richard Rodgers, to lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and originally performed by Mary Martin in the stage musical of the same name, but was later popularised by Julie Andrews in the 1965 film.  It was written by Andrew Frampton, Savan Kotecha and Steve Mac and produced by Mac. Inspired by the musical film The Sound of Music, the song was originally intended for American rapper Flo Rida, but he declined.   Critical reception  Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating that JLS had \"managed to successfully step outside their comfort zone\", giving the song four out of five stars.   Music video  The video for the single was shot in May 2010 during the band's visit to Los Angeles, California, while recording their second album.  Directed by Frank Borin, it takes its inspiration from the popular US TV series Entourage. The video shows the band turn up to a party in a nightclub in downtown L.A., where they also perform their song on a revolving stage.

But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists.\u201d \u2013 Ernest Hemingway  \u201cThough the Federal Reserve policy harms the average American, it benefits those in a position to take advantage of the cycles in monetary policy. The main beneficiaries are those who receive access to artificially inflated money and/or credit before the inflationary effects of the policy impact the entire economy. Federal Reserve policies also benefit big spending politicians who use the inflated currency created by the Fed to hide the true costs of the welfare-warfare state.\u201d \u2013 Ron Paul  Ernest Hemingway and Ron Paul never met. Ron Paul was completing medical school in 1961 when Hemingway committed suicide at his home in Idaho. I think they would have hit it off. I stumbled across the quote from Hemingway above. Those words could have come directly out of the mouth of Ron Paul. Both men spent their whole lives seeking the truth and presenting their ideas in a blunt straightforward manner. Hemingway is one of the most renowned writers in American history, with classics such as A Farewell to Arms , For Whom the Bell Tolls , and The Sun Also Rises to his credit.  He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954. He constructed a new literary style characterized by lean, hard, sparse dialogue. He influenced literature and young authors for decades. As a teenager I was immediately drawn to his gritty realistic novels. There was no nonsense to his novels. They always involved man\u2019s struggle against death and hardship. Most of his best work was done in the 1920s and 1930s, but he produced one of his finest works in 1951 towards the end of his life. Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize for his story about an epic battle between an old man and a great marlin.  Ernest Hemingway was bigger than life. Hemingway\u2019s real life reads like a Stephen Spielberg Indiana Jones movie. He was an ambulance driver in World War I, where he was seriously wounded. He had four wives. He lived in Paris during the 1920s associating with other famous \u201cLost Generation\u201d writers. He was a correspondent during the Spanish Civil War and World War II, while also joining in the fighting. He survived two plane crashes and multiple car accidents. He battled alcoholism and mental illness, eventually taking his own life, just as his father, brother and sister had done before him. His novels reflected the pain, struggle and inevitability of death that permeated his own life.  The Old Man and the Sea is a novel about Santiago, an old fisherman whose life is approaching its conclusion, and his final heroic struggle against a great marlin and the evil sharks that ultimately devour his prize. The mark of a great writer is the ability to tell a story that means many things to many people. Hemingway described his aim in writing this novel:  \u201cNo good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in. \u2026 I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea and a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things.\u201d  His novels always had a gritty reality to them.

The embryo that was to become Big brother and the Holding Company began when Peter Albin, a 21 year old, aspiring Folk Blues guitarist, who had been a part of South Bay Roots\u2019 music scene that also gave us Jerry Garcia, Robert Hunter and the Grateful Dead met Sam Andrew, a 23 year old guitarist who\u2019d been in bands since his teens in Okinawa and had studied languages and philosophy at University of SF and the Sorbonne.  Sam and Peter began jamming together in the basement/ballroom of an old Victorian mansion in the Haight \u2013Ashbury district. With the help of their friend, future manager and concert promoter Chet Helms (The Family Dog, Avalon Ballroom), Big Brother and The Holding Company was born.  In the first few months there were changes in personnel, guitarists and drummers came and went but Peter and Sam remained the core of the band.\u00a0 Chet introduced Peter and Sam to James Gurley who was 26 and from Detroit. James became the lead guitarist and his unique style of playing became the early signature sound of the band. Peter met Dave Getz, also 26, an abstract painter and drummer who toured Europe with a Dixieland Jazz band and had played jazz since his teens.\u00a0 Dave Getz joined in March of 1966, bringing the needed power and energy to the rhythm section.  Big Brother as a four man ensemble was a featured band at some of the first acid-fueled, dance-concerts like the Trips Festival and the Tribal Stomp and though they already had many fans and were headlining they wanted something else to complete their sound: a strong female lead singer.  They auditioned several singers but it wasn\u2019t until Chet Helms convinced fellow Texan,\u00a0 \u00a0Janis Joplin to come out to San Francisco that the band was complete.  For most of 1966 and 1967 they played at venues all over California and the West Coast. \u00a0They also spent a month in Chicago playing at the club \u2018Mother Blues\u201d During this time they lived together communally and rehearsed every day.\u00a0 As in many great rock bands they thought of themselves not only as a band but as individual artists and collaborators. They all recognized that Janis was a great singer and had the potential to be a star, but they also knew that each member brought something to the table.  Big Brother and the Holding Company, like many of the great bands of the era (The Beatles, The Rolling Stones) were about something; it had had its own \u2018persona\u2019.\u00a0 For the followers of the music scene, the people who danced and listened at the Fillmore and the Avalon, Big Brother and the Holding Company were greater than the sum of its parts.  The Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967 was the first great international rock festival and it was the moment when Big Brother and its lead singer Janis Joplin blew open the collective mind of the audience and rose to the top of the Rock music hierarchy. It was also the moment in which that same audience discovered Jimi Hendrix, Otis Redding and several other artists that were destined to take rock music to the next level.  In 1968 Big Brother signed with Columbia Records and Albert Grossman (Bob Dylan, Peter Paul and Mary, etc) became their manager.

Cardinals in conclave to elect a new pope, Sistine Chapel, Vatican City, 2005.  Arturo Mari\u2014Vatican Pool/Getty Images  History  The early history of papal elections remains unclear. There is some evidence that the early popes, including Peter , appointed their own successors, though this practice evidently failed to gain support. Subsequently, the election of the bishop of Rome (the pope) mirrored the election process for bishops in other towns: the local clergy were the electors; neighbouring bishops acted as presidents of the assembly and judges of the election; and the laity indicated their approval or disapproval more or less tumultuously. Elections were sometimes challenged or disrupted; as early as 217, a schism occurred and rival popes were elected (see antipope ). After the Roman emperor Constantine legalized Christianity in the early 4th century, the emperor assumed a role in the election, often presiding over the process and at times imposing a candidate. In the 6th century the Byzantine emperor Justinian I asserted that the newly elected pope could not be consecrated until his election had been confirmed by the emperor. Two centuries later the Carolingian kings of the Franks , the preeminent power in Latin Christendom, replaced the Byzantine emperor as the secular authority who received formal notification of the results of papal elections, and Western rulers subsequently appropriated the rights and privileges assumed by Justinian and his successors. In the 10th and 11th centuries popes were appointed by Otto I and Henry III , respectively.  In the 11th century, when the entire church underwent reformation, the system of papal election was transformed. In 1059 Pope Nicholas II (1059\u201361) issued a decree that reformed the electoral procedure, limiting the role of the emperor. The election was to be carried out by the cardinal bishops with the assent of the cardinal priests and deacons and the acclamation of the people. Despite these reforms, papal elections in the 12th century continued to be turbulent affairs. In the 1130s and the 1160s and \u201970s, schisms occurred as disputed elections led to the consecration of popes and antipopes. The third Lateran Council (1179), which followed one of these schisms, made all cardinals electors and required a two-thirds majority to decide the election.  Similar Topics  conciliarism  Nevertheless, abuses still occurred. When the cardinals failed to elect a pope for more than two years after the death of Clement IV (1265\u201368), the local magistrate locked the electors in the episcopal palace, removed the roof (subjecting the cardinals to the elements), and allowed the cardinals nothing but bread and water until they made their selection, Gregory X (1271\u201376). At the second Council of Lyon in 1274, Gregory promulgated a constitution that called for the cardinals to meet in closed conclave and imposed strict regulations to guide the election; Pope Boniface VIII (1294\u20131303) ordered this decree incorporated into canon law. Despite the wisdom and rigour of Gregory\u2019s reform, papal elections continued to face difficulties in the 14th century. The most serious problem resulted in the Western Schism , when in 1378 two groups of cardinals elected rival popes, one residing in Avignon and the other in Rome , and a third group of cardinals, convening in Pisa in 1409, elected a third. The crisis caused by the schism was partially resolved by the reforms implemented at the Council of Constance (1414\u201318): the claims to the papacy of the Avignon pope, Benedict (XIII) , and the pope selected by the Pisan cardinals, John (XXIII) , were rejected, and each was branded a schismatic \u201cantipope\u201d; Gregory XII grudgingly resigned; and Martin V was elected to replace him.  Christianity Quiz  Electoral rules were further regularized in the 16th and 17th centuries.

The title must be attractive and arouse curiosity and, at the same time, depict something from the movie, whether we\u2019re talking about a character, a place or a situation. So choosing the way others already have \u201ctraveled\u201d seems pretty motivated. Often there is no connection between the film and music that lends the title, but one thing is certain: it is not a coincidence. We found ten movies which have titles inspired from ten famous songs.  1. Jumpin Jack Flash  The 1986 comedy starring Whoopy Golberg has the same name as the song written by The Rolling Stones in 1968. Of course is no coincidence, because the song appears in the film in two versions, the original and the remake done by Aretha Franklin.  2. This Must Be the Place  The title of the film directed by Italian director Paolo Sorrentino starring Sean Penn is inspired by a song from Talking Heads. The lead singer even appears in the film. The song also appears-in soundtrack. Sean Penn plays Cheyenne, a retired rock star living off his royalties in Dublin, who returns to New York City to find the man responsible for humiliation his deceased father during WWII.  3. Pretty woman  The 1990 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere has the same name as the famous song by Roy Orbison in 1964. \u201cPretty woman, walking down the street, pretty woman, the kind I like to meet\u201d\u2026 catchy, isn\u2019t it?  4. Sweet Home Alabama  Sweet Home Alabama is a 2002 romantic comedy with Reese Witherspoon, Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey and also a rock song from Lynyrd Skynyrd released on their second album, the Second Helping, in 1974. You\u2019re going to see Reese Witherspoon play a young woman with a Southern background who runs away from her husband in Alabama and reinvents herself as a New York socialite.  5. Boys do not cry  The incredible song by The Cure from 1980 is also the name of a fairly successful independent film with Hilary Swank playing the role of Brandon Teena, a transgendered teen who preferred life in a male identity until it was discovered he was born biologically female. The role earned her an Oscar for her interpretation. The movie also received numerous awards and nominations and 14 year later, Hilary Swank is still mostly identified by that incredible performance.  6. Stand by me  Ben E. King\u2019s song from 1961 had dozens of artistic interpretations from famous artists such as John Lennon, Otis Redding, Jimmy Hendrix, U2, Usher, Elton John, but only one film was named after it: the drama about inspired by a Stephen King novel, directed by Rob Reiner in 1986. The plot goes something like this: ffter the death of a friend, a writer recounts a boyhood journey to find the body of a missing boy.  7. Boogie Nights  The film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson is a sort of chronicle about the world of pornography in the \u201870s and \u201880s, with actors like Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore and Heather Graham. The name of the film is inspired by a song performed by the funk band Heatwave in 1976.  8. Addicted to love  In 1986 Robert Palmer pulled out a song that quickly became a hit. Unfortunately, the romantic from 1997 whose title is inspired by Palmer\u2019s song never had the same success. The film stars Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick who realize they love each other while stalking their ex partners. Stalking, bringing people together since 1997.  9. Tequila sunrise  We have a song, a movie and a cocktail. The song played by The Eagles in 1973 inspired a famous action movie with Mel Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell made 15 years later, in 1988. Even today, fans still remember Mel Gibson for his performance in Tequila Sunrise.  10.

{"input": "Context: Cell Mates (play)Cell Mates is a play by Simon Gray. It opened at the Albery Theatre, London on 17 February 1995, starring Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall, with Gray himself directing. Despite having performed successfully for several weeks during the pre-London warm up dates in Guildford and Watford then at the Richmond Theatre, Fry left the West End production after three days. His understudy stepped in, until Fry was replaced by Simon Ward. Nevertheless, the production closed on 25 March 1995.  Later in 1995, Gray released an autobiographical account of the production, called Fat Chance. It was published by Faber and Faber.  Plot   The play concerns George Blake, who has been convicted for spying for the Russians and sentenced to forty-two years imprisonment, and a fellow prisoner, Sean Bourke. Bourke helps Blake escape to Moscow, after which Blake did not want to let Bourke leave Moscow to return to his native Ireland.  Controversy   In 1995, Stephen Fry famously walked out of the play near the start of its West End run, after his performance received a bad review in the Financial Times. It was reported at the time that he suffered an attack of stage fright, but he has since disclosed that it was bipolar disorder. Fry walked out of the production for good, leaving only an apology, and provoking its early closure.   Simon Gray described Fry's action as \"cowardly\", and in a statement to the press said: \"It is disgraceful that so much media attention has been devoted to this squalid little story . . . I confess my own failure as a director was to have cast Stephen Fry in the first place, and in the second place, not to have acknowledged my error by requesting his departure after his (self-proclaimed) inadequacies were abundantly clear to me.\" In response to the suggestion his reaction was insensitive to Fry's predicament, Gray added: \"I'm a friend of Stephen's. I have great sympathy because he was hurt and stressed, but what he left behind him was the most awful chaos and distress for other people who loved him, including me.\"   Fry disappeared from the public eye, travelling to Belgium, and contemplating suicide.

But in fact The Duchess, which opens on September 5, tells the story of Georgiana Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire, who died more than 200 years ago \u2013 and the film\u2019s use of Diana to sell tickets is not quite as controversial as it may seem.  For Diana and Georgiana, both Spencers born at the family home at Althorp, shared striking similarities. Both were shy teenagers who blossomed after being catapulted to fame by marrying older, wealthier men. Both became fashion icons, with the Duchess sitting for artists such as Gainsborough and Reynolds, just as her great great great great niece would for Mario Testino, two centuries later.  And, like Diana, Georgiana found consolation in the outpouring of public affection when it became obvious that her marriage to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, would never deliver her longed-for dream of happy-ever-after.  Georgiana suffered the humiliation of being trapped in a very public m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, seeking an escape through alleged eating disorders as well as near-ruinous addictions to gambling, drink and drugs.  Amanda Foreman, whose best-selling book, Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire, was the inspiration for the new film, says: \u201cYou can\u2019t deny there are extraordinary comparisons. Like Diana, Georgiana had that ability to make people feel special. But she had a dark side which became all-destroying.\u201d  Lady Georgiana Spencer was just 17 when she married the 26-year-old Duke. The Spencer and Cavendish families were Whigs, but William\u2019s position as one of the nation\u2019s most important dukes made it impossible for him to dabble in politics. So Georgiana become the public face of the family\u2019s political ambitions.  She became the first woman to appear on political platforms, and during the 1784 election campaign famously traded kisses for votes on the hustings.  While her handling of her public image was masterful, her control over her private life was less impressive. She and her husband had little in common besides a desire to produce an heir, which | Question: Based on a true story, which 2008 film starred Keira Knightley as the tragic Georgiana Cavendish?", "truth": ["duchess"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6050", "mistake": "The Duchess", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

The Canary Islands form an archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean facing the western coast of Africa , between the parallels of 27\u00b04' and 29\u00b03'N. lat., and the meridians of 13\u00b03' and 18\u00b02'W. long. They consist of seven important islands and some islets. From east to west the first encountered are Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, the nearest to the African continent; then come Tenerife and Gran Canaria, while farther westward are Palma, Gomera, and Hierro (or Ferro). The total area of the islands is about 3256 square miles; their population, according to the census of 1900, was 358,564. The country in general is mountainous and volcanic; in Tenerife the Pico de Teyde, or Peak of Tenerife, reaches the height of 12,200 feet, and towers above the other mountains which extend throughout the islands, generally from north-east to south-west. Natural caverns abound, some of them very extensive. There is no great river, but there are numerous springs and torrents. The fauna differs little from that of Europe , with the exception of the dromedary and the thistle-finch, or canary-bird. There are extensive forests of pine and laurel, and some stems reach a gigantic height. The climate of the islands is mild and salubrious; hence they are much frequented as winter resorts. The Canary Islands are essentially agricultural. Their soil, usually fertile, though subject to frequent droughts, produces an abundance of fruits, sugar-cane, and tobacco. The wines are exquisite, and together with the fruits, tobacco, and fish, which is good and plentiful, form the principal articles of commerce for export. Much cochineal, also, is manufactured in the islands. The most important centres of population are: Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Orotava, and La Laguna in the island of Tenerife; Las Palmas and Arracife in Gran Canaria; Santa Cruz de la Palma in the island of Palma; Quia and Valverde in that of Hierro.  Civil and ecclesiastical divisions  The Canary Islands constitute a civil province, a judicial district (audiencia), with its seat at Palmas, for the administration of justice , and a military governorship (captaincy-general). Ecclesiastically they are divided into two dioceses , suffragan of Seville, that of Tenerife, with episcopal residence at Santa Cruz, and that of Canaries, with residence at Las Palmas. In 1906 the Diocese of Tenerife, which comprises the islands of Tenerife, Gomera, Palma, and Hierro, had a Catholic population of 171,045, with 62 parishes , 86 priests , 60 churches , and 167 chapels ; while the Diocese of Canaries had a Catholic population of 83,378, 50 Protestants , 42 parishes , 103 priests , 42 churches , and 113 chapels , and comprises the Grand Canary, Fuerteventura, and Lanzarote. The courts are held at Santa Cruz de Tenerife. All ports are free, i.e. merchandise entering them is exempt from duty . The inhabitants satisfy the obligation of military service, not in the ranks of the peninsular army, but in the local territorial militia.  History  The primitive populations of the Canary Islands were the Guanches, a white race, vigorous, of high stature, fair-haired and blue-eyed, and leading mostly a pastoral life. At the time of their conquest by the Europeans they used weapons and utensils of wood and stone, were clothed in skins of animals, and lived in the numerous natural grottos. Their ornaments were of bone, sea-shells, and baked clay. They were hospitable and deeply attached to their independence. Each island was divided into separate states, ruled over by kings, who were assisted by the chiefs of the noble families and the most esteemed priests or soothsayers.

{"input": "Context: DICKENS, C.: Barnaby Rudge (Unabridged) - NaxosDICKENS, C.: Barnaby Rudge (Unabridged)  Barnaby Rudge  \u00a0  Barnaby Rudge is something of a  mystery story; therefore it might be advisable to read these notes after having  listened to the novel. In considering its background etc., disclosures about  the plot are made that may spoil your enjoyment.  I have gone to work  this morning in good twig, strong hope, and cheerful spirits. Last night I was  unutterably and impossible-to-form-an-idea-of-ably miserable\u2026  \u2013 Dickens in a letter to his friend Forster, 1841  Barnaby  Rudge was the second novel to  appear in Dickens\u2019s experimental magazine Master Humphrey\u2019s Clock, which  he launched in 1840. He was a young man with the proven successes of The  Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby behind  him, and this encouraged him to be innovative. Master Humphrey\u2019s Clock was  a literary magazine of random articles and short stories, linked by the  fictional \u2018Master Humphrey\u2019: he kept this assortment in his clock to be  produced as material for discussion by a literary group (which included,  ill-advisedly, Mr Pickwick). This original presentation by Dickens, however,  did not appeal to his public, who wanted another novel rather than a collection  of stories. As the magazine\u2019s circulation began to decline seriously, Dickens  was forced to work hard to save it from failure. Adapting an existing short  story, Dickens wrote, as a weekly serial, The Old Curiosity Shop, which  was then followed, in the same format, by Barnaby Rudge. Although  Dickens always had an obsessive desire to write, this was even for him a  punishing schedule; sometimes he was writing episodes for both novels at the  same time.  The  spectre of his magazine\u2019s failure, so soon after it was launched, led Dickens  to reconsider the very first novel he had attempted to write in 1836\u2014Gabriel  Varden, the Locksmith of London.  It had proved to be a problematic story for him to tell, and after the success  of Sketches by Boz it became submerged in the rush of publishers to  capitalise on this brilliant young writer. Dickens, always a shrewd businessman,  played one off against another. By the time he had settled with the publishers  Chapman and Hall in 1839, the novel, now retitled Barnaby Rudge, had  been abandoned in favour of the development of Master Humphrey\u2019s Clock.  Barnaby  Rudge, which had proved so  difficult for Dickens to write in 1836, now became, in itself, an innovation  for him. He knew that, since the great success of Sir Walter Scott in the genre  of the historical novel, any subsequent aspiring novelist must have a success  in this field to be taken seriously. Dickens only attempted to write outside  his own age twice, with Barnaby Rudge and A Tale of Two Cities.  It was his reading of the historian Thomas Carlyle\u2019s dramatic retelling of the  French Revolution that inspired Dickens to try his own hand at recreating the  vivid scenes of violent revolt that took place in the notorious Gordon Riots in  London in 1780.  As a socially aware novelist, Dickens wanted to show his nineteenth-century  readers how particular confrontational moments in history had helped to create  the free-thinking era in which they now lived. It is no accident, therefore,  that both his historical novels are based around revolutions. In A Tale of  Two Cities it is an enlightened revolution, whereas in Barnaby Rudge the  uprising is based on prejudice and bigotry.  The  Gordon riots were induced by the MP Lord George Gordon in response to changes  in the laws against Roman Catholics. Since the Reformation, Catholics had been  restricted from holding public office, being MPs, voting, possessing land or  worshipping openly. They were taxed heavily and denied education at the  universities. In 1778 the Catholic Relief Act was passed to alleviate some of | Question: Which eponymous hero of a Charles Dickens novel keeps a pet Raven called 'Grip'?", "truth": ["barnaby rudge"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6698", "mistake": "Barnaby Rudge", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

He is one of the most extensively translated of American authors.  Jack London writing The Sea Wolf, 1904.  Jack London State Historic Park  Deserted by his father, a roving astrologer, London was raised in Oakland , California, by his spiritualist mother and his stepfather, whose surname, London, he took. At 14 he quit school to escape poverty and gain adventure. He explored San Francisco Bay in his sloop , alternately stealing oysters or working for the government fish patrol. He went to Japan as a sailor and saw much of the United States as a hobo riding freight trains and as a member of Kelly\u2019s industrial army (one of the many protest armies of unemployed born of the panic of 1893). He saw depression conditions, was jailed for vagrancy, and in 1894 became a militant socialist. London educated himself at public libraries with the writings of Charles Darwin , Karl Marx , and Friedrich Nietzsche , usually in popularized forms. At 19 he crammed a four-year high school course into one year and entered the University of California , Berkeley, but after a year he quit school to seek a fortune in the Klondike gold rush of 1897. Returning the next year, still poor and unable to find work, he decided to earn a living as a writer.  London studied magazines and then set himself a daily schedule of producing sonnets , ballads , jokes, anecdotes , adventure stories, or horror stories, steadily increasing his output. The optimism and energy with which he attacked his task are best conveyed in his autobiographical novel Martin Eden (1909), perhaps his most enduring work. Within two years stories of his Alaskan adventures, though often crude, began to win acceptance for their fresh subject matter and virile force. His first book, The Son of the Wolf (1900), gained a wide audience. During the remainder of his life he produced steadily, completing 50 books of fiction and nonfiction in 17 years. Although he became the highest-paid writer in the United States, his earnings never matched his expenditures, and he was never freed of the urgency of writing for money. He sailed a ketch to the South Pacific, telling of his adventures in The Cruise of the Snark (1911). In 1910 he settled on a ranch near Glen Ellen, California, where he built his grandiose Wolf House. He maintained his socialist beliefs almost to the end of his life.

{"input": "Context: The History of Co-operatives - The Ontario Co-operative ...On Co-op -  The Ontario Co-operative Association \u00bb All About Co-operatives \u00bb The History of Co-operatives  Send to a Friend  The Rochdale Pioneers  The co-operative movement has a long and fascinating history. There is a common thread that runs throughout this history: societies improve when people\u00a0work together to improve their lives and the lives of others in their community.  Origins  In 1844, Queen Victoria had been on the English throne for seven years and the country was changing rapidly. The Industrial Revolution was underway, and invention followed invention with unprecedented rapidity, making the growing factories \u201cefficient.\u201d\u00a0However, the world did not look as bright for the new urban working classes.  There were no social benefits: no public health care, no unemployment insurance, and no pensions. Unemployment was rampant. Only one in seven men in Britain had the vote and, of course, no women at all were enfranchised. In the city of Manchester (population 550,000), there was on average only one toilet for every 250 people and infant mortality was endemic.  Yet progress was being made. Slavery had been abolished throughout the British Empire 10 years earlier. The Mines Act of 1842 stopped children under 10 from working in the mines, and this was followed in 1844 by the Factory Act which prevented children between eight and 13 from working more than six and an half hours per day. Marx and Engels were finishing the Communist Manifesto and Charles Dickens was bringing the plight of the poor to the attention of the general populace with such best sellers as Oliver Twist (1839) and A Christmas Carol (1843).\u00a0  And in Rochdale, a working class textile manufacturing town, \u00a0a group of 30 people \u2013 weavers, tailors, shoemakers, carpenters and other skilled tradesmen \u2013 banded together to form the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers. The pioneers were tired of paying high prices for poor quality food at shops run by factory owners. Inspired by the teachings of Robert Owen, an early co-operative proponent, the men pooled their meagre savings to buy food supplies in Toad Lane and sold these staples back to society members at fair market prices. On December 21, 1844, they opened a shop.  The shop sold candles, tea, fuel and basic food stuffs. With the surplus from the store, which was their own, they bought more goods. At the end of the first year their surplus was sufficient enough to increase their stock and set aside reserve funds. It was also enough to issue a rebate to members in proportion to the amount of business each had done with the co-op during the first year. Ten years later, over 1,000 co-operatives operated in Britain alone.  The Rochdale Pioneer Society was by no means the first of its kind. The Fenwick Weavers\u2019 Association in Scotland dated back to 1769 and is generally considered the first co-op ever created. Before that, European artists\u2019 guilds of the early Renaissance approximated co-ops\u00a0and the ancient Chinese had co-operatively organized memorial societies. The reason why the Rochdale Pioneers were so distinctive was their success. The founders carefully studied past attempts and constructed a set of rules, which came to be known as the Rochdale Principles.  These principles were a turning point in economic democracy, and formed the basis for the growing co-operative movement worldwide. Today, there are thousands of co-operatives all over the world with over 600 million members, all of which subscribe to what are now known as the seven international principles of co-operation:  Voluntary and Open Membership  Co-operation among Co-operatives  Concern for Community  Note: The seminal Rochdale shop ceased operation many years ago. The co-operative merged with other co-ops into a greater union and the original site is now a museum.

{"input": "Context: Harriet Tubman - Leading Slaves into Freedom - InventorsHarriet Tubman - Leading Slaves into Freedom  Harriet Tubman - Leading Slaves into Freedom  Harriet Tubman - Leading Slaves into Freedom  Leading Hundreds of Slaves to Freedom Along the Underground Railroad  By Mary Bellis  Updated August 12, 2016.  Harriet Tubman, born in 1820, was a runaway slave from Maryland who became known as the \"Moses of her people.\" Over the course of 10 years, and at great personal risk, she led hundreds of slaves to freedom along the Underground Railroad, a secret network of safe houses where runaway slaves could stay on their journey north to freedom. She later became a leader in the abolitionist movement, and during the Civil War she was a spy with for the federal forces in South Carolina as well as a nurse.  Although not a traditional railroad, the underground railroad was a critical system of transporting slaves to freedom in the mid-1800s. One of the most famous conductors was Harriet Tubman. Between 1850 and 1858, she helped more than 300 slaves reach freedom.  Early Years and Escape from Slavery  Tubman's name at birth was Araminta Ross. She was one of 11 children of Harriet and Benjamin Ross born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland. As a child, Ross was \"hired out\" by her master as a nursemaid for a small baby, much like the nursemaid in the picture.  Ross had to stay awake all night so that the baby wouldn't cry and wake the mother. If Ross fell asleep, the baby's mother whipped her. From a very young age, Ross was determined to gain her freedom.  As a slave, Araminta Ross was scarred for life when she refused to help in the punishment of another young slave. A young man had gone to the store without permission, and when he returned, the overseer wanted to whip him. He asked Ross to help but she refused. When the young man started to run away, the overseer picked up a heavy iron weight and threw it at him. He missed the young man and hit Ross instead. The weight nearly crushed her skull and left a deep scar. She was unconscious for days, and suffered from seizures for the rest of her life.  In 1844, Ross married a free black named John Tubman and took his last name. She also changed her first name, taking her mother's name, Harriet. In 1849, worried that she and the other slaves on the plantation were going to be sold, Tubman decided to run away. Her husband refused to go with her, so she set out with her two brothers, and followed the North Star in the sky to guide her north to freedom. Her brothers became frightened and turned back, but she continued on and reached Philadelphia. There she found work as a household servant and saved her money so she could return to help others escape.  Harriet Tubman During the Civil War  During the Civil War, Tubman worked for the Union army as a nurse, a cook, and a spy. Her experience leading slaves along the Underground Railroad was especially helpful because she knew the land well. She recruited a group of former slaves to hunt for rebel camps and report on the movement of the Confederate troops. In 1863, she went with Colonel James Montgomery and about 150 black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina. Because she had inside information from her scouts, the Union gunboats were able to surprise the Confederate rebels.  At first, when the Union Army came through and burned plantations, slaves hid in the woods. But when they realized that the gunboats could take them behind Union lines to freedom, they came running from all directions, bringing as many of their belongings as they could carry. Tubman later said, \"I never saw such a sight.\" Tubman played other roles in the war effort, including working as a nurse. Folk remedies she learned during her years living in Maryland would come in very handy.  Tubman worked as a nurse during the war, trying to heal the sick. Many people in the hospital died from dysentery, a disease associated with | Question: \"Who was known as the \"\"Moses of her people\"\" for leading escaped slaves to freedom during the US Civil War?\" ?", "truth": ["moses of her people", "harriet tubman", "araminta ross"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3184", "mistake": "Harriet Tubman", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

The Somerset all-rounder's blistering performance helped bring England victory by an innings and 120 runs in the second Cornhill Test.  He hit 108 runs in England's first innings and today took eight wickets for just 34 runs to contribute to Pakistan's second innings total of all out for 139.  In fact, Tony Greig is the only other England player to score a century and take more than five wickets in an innings. He hit 143 runs and took six wickets for 164 against the West Indies at Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1974.  Botham was just unplayable  Pakistan captain Wasim Bari  England captain Mike Brearley said of Botham's performance: \"He is colossus at the moment.\"  Botham made his Test debut at the age of 21 against Australia at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, in July last year.  In that match, he took five wickets for 74 runs to help bowl out the opposition for 243. His wife Kathryn, who was eight months pregnant with the couple's first child, was in the spectator stands.  Today at Trent Bridge, it was Botham's swinging deliveries which managed to beat his Pakistani opponents.  Afterwards, Pakistan captain Wasim Bari said: \"I have never seen a ball swing so much in bright weather...Botham was just unplayable.\"  The Pakistan team includes many players new to Test cricket and unused to English weather conditions.  Bari continued: \"England bowled better, batted better and fielded better than we did. And this man Botham is a magnificent cricketer.\"  In Context  Ian Botham went on to become one of England's greatest ever all-rounders.  Perhaps his best performance was in the 1981 Ashes series against Australia. After a poor run of results ending with a draw in the second Test, he resigned the England captaincy.  England were one down and facing almost certain defeat in the third Test at Headingley. Botham saved the match, England ended up winning the series three-one, and the all-rounder's legendary status was assured.  He played in 102 Test matches in a career spanning from 1977-92. His highest-ever batting score was 208 - his best performance with the ball was eight wickets for 34 runs.  Since retiring from the game, he has become a television commentator and in 2003 became an adviser to his old county team of Somerset.  He has also walked thousands of miles raising money for Leukaemia Research and more recently for The Noah's Ark appeal  which is building a children's hospital in Wales.  His son, Liam, played county cricket for Hampshire in 1996 but has since taken up professional rugby.

{"input": "Context: A nation of shopkeepers - meaning and origin.'A nation of shopkeepers' - the meaning and origin of this phrase  A nation of shopkeepers  Origin  Adam Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, 1776, wrote:  \"To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a  people of customers, may at first sight, appear a project fit  only for a nation of shopkeepers. It is, however, a project  altogether unfit for a nation of shopkeepers, but extremely fit  for a nation whose government is influenced by shopkeepers. \"  'The English are a nation of shopkeepers' - Adam Smith or Napoleon?  Napoleon I, who was familiar with Smith's work, is reported as later using a French version to dismiss England's preparedness for war against France:  \"L'Angleterre est une nation de boutiquiers.\"  Josiah Tucker, the Dean of Gloucester, preceded them both in 1766, although not with the precise text of the currently-used version of the phrase:  \"And what is true of a shopkeeper is true of a shopkeeping nation.\"  Nation of shopkeepersThe phrase \"a nation of shopkeepers\", commonly attributed to Napoleon, is a reference to England or the United Kingdom.    There is reason to doubt that Napoleon ever used it.  No contemporaneous French newspaper mentions that he did.  The phrase was first used in an offensive sense by the French revolutionary Bertrand Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac on June 11, 1794 in a speech to the National Convention: \u201cLet Pitt then boast of his victory to his nation of shopkeepers\u201d.   Later, during the Napoleonic wars, the British press mentioned the phrase, attributing it either to \u201cthe French\u201d or to Napoleon himself.     A later, explicit source is Barry Edward O'Meara, who was surgeon to Napoleon during his exile in St. Helena.   If O'Meara is to be believed, Napoleon said:    There may be grounds to doubt the veracity of this account.   The supposed French original as uttered by Napoleon (une nation de boutiquiers) is frequently cited, but it has no attestation.  O'Meara conversed with Napoleon in Italian, not French.  There is no other source.  After the war English newspapers sometimes tried to correct the impression.  For example the following article appeared in the Morning Post of 28 May 1832:   ENGLAND A NATION OF SHOPKEEPERS  This complimentary term, for so we must consider it, as applied to a Nation which has derived its principal prosperity from its commercial greatness, has been erroneously attributed, from time to time, to all the leading Revolutionists of France.  To our astonishment we now find it applied exclusively to BONAPARTE.  Than this nothing can be further from the fact.  NAPOLEON was scarcely known at the time, he being merely an Officer of inferior rank, totally unconnected with politics.  The occasion on which that splenetic, but at the same time, complimentary observation was made was that of the ever-memorable battle of the 1st of June.  The oration delivered on that occasion was by M. BARRERE [sic], in which, after describing our beautiful country as one \"on which the sun scarce designs to shed its light\", he described England as a nation of shopkeepers.  In any case the phrase did not originate with Napoleon, or even Bar\u00e8re.  It first appears in a non-pejorative sense in The Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, who wrote:   Smith is also quoted as saying that Britain was \"a nation that is governed by shopkeepers\", which is how he put it in the first (1776) edition.  It is unlikely that either Adam Smith or Napoleon used the phrase to describe that class of small retailers who would not even have had the franchise.  The phrase may have been part of standard 18th century economic dialogue.  It has been suggested that Napoleon may have heard it during a meeting of the French Convention on 11 June 1794, when Bertrand Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac quoted Smith's phrase.

Reuters/Lucas Jackson +  3/3  Best supporting actor nominee for ''No Country For Old Men,'' Javier Bardem from Spain, poses at the 80th annual Academy Awards, the Oscars, in Hollywood February 24, 2008.  Reuters/Lucas Jackson +  LOS ANGELES Javier Bardem became the first Spanish actor to win an Oscar on Sunday by taking the best supporting actor award for his chilling portrait of a psychopathic killer in \"No Country For Old Men.\"  Bardem, 38, who has won virtually every movie award this season for his performance, claimed the Oscar in his second bid for the film industry's highest honor.  He previously was a best leading actor candidate for his role as a Cuban poet in the 2000 biopic \"Before Night Falls.\"  In \"No Country,\" a violent modern western thriller written and directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, Bardem plays a peculiarly coiffed killer who cuts a violent swathe across small-town Texas, often deciding the fate of random victims with the toss of a coin.  \"Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to think I could do that and put one of the most horrible hair cuts in history on my head,\" Bardem said in his acceptance speech.  He said he wanted to share the Oscar with the cast of the movie, and he dedicated the award to Spain and to his mother, the Spanish movie and television actress Pilar Bardem, who accompanied him to the ceremony.  \"Mama, this is for you. This is for your grandparents and your parents, Rafael and Matilde, This is for the comedians of Spain who like you have brought dignity and pride to our profession. This is for Spain and this is for all of you,\" said Bardem, speaking in rapid Spanish.  A household name at home with four Goyas -- the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars -- and a movie and television career stretching back 18 years, Bardem has moved into mainstream Hollywood in recent years with movies like \"Collateral\" and \"Love in the Time of Cholera.\"  He is the youngest in a Spanish family of actors and started acting at the age of 6. His breakthrough performance came in \"Before Night Falls\" (2000) in which he was nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas.  Bardem lives in Madrid and has recently been romantically linked with Spanish actress Penelope Cruz.

Painting is not done to decorate apartments. It is an instrument of war.\u201d said Pablo Picasso. I chose to write my another post  about Pablo Picasso\u2019s great painting called \u201dGirl Before a Mirror\u201d which he painted in 1932. I went over the paintings many times and that was definitely my favourite. Pablo Picasso is definitely one of my favourite painters and sculptors of all time. He\u2019s done some amazing works during his career. Picasso demonstrated uncanny artistic talent in his early years, painting in a realistic manner through his childhood and adolescence; during the first decade of the twentieth century his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas (pablopicasso.org). As one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is widely known for co-founding the Cubist movement, and the great painting \u201dGirl Before a Mirror\u201d was actually painted during Picasso\u2019s cubism period.  For me, \u201dGirl Before a Mirror\u2019 is a painting that talks about reflections of self; how we see ourselves versus how others see us; or the duality of our natures. There are so many levels you can use to spur creativity and critical thinking about Picasso\u2019s paintings. I can also imagine this Picasso painting in a philosophy class or any venue in which people are wrestling with what constitutes a self.\u00a0 The woman on the painting is Marie-Therese Walter,\u00a0Picasso\u2019s youthful mistress and favored model in the 1930s. \u00a0Picasso shows her\u00a0both in profile and frontally as she peers into a mirror that reflects a woman she is not. I see a beautiful pregnant woman with a perky and round breasts\u00a0who is looking at her reflection in the mirror but seeing it as her future reflection. In her reflection in the mirror, she sees that her body is aged and she is not very happy about it. I just love the paintings that when you look at them, you don\u2019t get the meaning of the painting right away; instead we have to look deeper and deeper inside the painting to get the real meaning. Sometimes when I look at his paintings, I start imagine things that are actually not there and that\u2019s exactly what Picasso does in his paintings, and that\u2019s why he is one of my favourite painters of all time. This is what he said many times during his interesting life: \u201cEverything you can imagine is real.\u201d  A lot of people didn\u2019t like Pablo Picasso as a person because of his problematic life but a lot of people definitely liked and respected his art. He rewarded art not just with his creative and unique styles, but also with the innumerous paintings, drawings, sculptures he produced. His painting \u201dGirl Before a Mirror\u201d is just one example of how talented he was. I really love his work and the way he painted. I am going to finish my essay with a quote by him which definitely reflects his style and his work: \u201cIf I paint a wild horse, you might not see the horse\u2026 but surely you will see the wildness!\u201d  Girl Before A Mirror by Pablo PicassoGirl Before A Mirror by Pablo Picasso  Courtesy of www.PabloPicasso.org  Girl Before Mirror was painted in March 1932. It was produced in the style Picasso was using at the time                           and evoked an image of Vanity such as had been utilized in art in earlier eras, though Picasso shifts                           the emphasis and creates a very different view of the image.

{"input": "Context: TylosTylos was the name used by the Greeks to refer to Bahrain, as the centre of pearl trading, when Nearchus came to discover it serving under Alexander the Great.  From the 6th to 3rd century BC Bahrain was included in the Persian Empire by the Achaemenids, an Iranian dynasty.  The Greek admiral Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: \u201cThat in the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton tree, from which are manufactured clothes called sindones, a very different degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia.\u201d  The Greek historian, Theophrastus, states that much of the islands were covered in these cotton trees and that Tylos was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.  Ares was also worshipped by the country's indigenous and Greek population.   It is not known whether Bahrain was part of the Seleucid Empire, although the archaeological site at Qalat Al Bahrain has been proposed as a Seleucid base in the Persian Gulf.   Alexander had planned to settle the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf with Greek colonists, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Tylos was very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.  Tylos even became the site of Greek athletic contests.   The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic Tilmun (from Dilmun).  The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until Ptolemy\u2019s Geographia when the inhabitants are referred to as 'Thilouanoi'.  Some place names in Bahrain go back to the Tylos era, for instance, the residential suburb of Arad in Muharraq, is believed to originate from \"Arados\", the ancient Greek name for Muharraq island.   The Greek historian Strabo believed that the Phoenicians originated from Bahrain.  Herodotus also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain.   This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: \"In the Greek geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Arad, Bahrain, which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples.\"  The people of Tyre in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words \"Tylos\" and \"Tyre\" has been commented upon.  However, there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.   Herodotus's account (written c. 440\u00a0BC) refers to the Phoenicians originating from Bahrain. (History, I:1).   With the waning of Seleucid Greek power, Tylos was incorporated into Characene or Mesenian, the state founded in what today is Kuwait by Hyspaosines in 127BC. A building inscription found in Bahrain indicates that Hyspoasines occupied the islands, (and it also mention his wife, Thalassia). From the third century BC to the arrival of Islam in the seventh century AD, Bahrain was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties; the Parthians and Sassanids.  By about 250 BC, the Seleucids lost their territories to Parthians, an Iranian tribe from Central Asia. The Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons in the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.   In the third century AD, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and held the area until the rise of Islam, four centuries later. Ardashir, the first ruler of the Sassanian dynasty marched forward to Oman and Bahrain and defeat Sanatruq  (or Satiran), probably the Parthian governor of Bahrain.

He also wrote and presented a Christmas special called James May's Top Toys (for BBC One) exploring the toys of his childhood. This list was followed up the next year by a sequel of sorts, broadcast on BBC Two, entitled James May: My Sister's Top Toys, this time attempting to investigate the gender divide of toy appeal. In late 2006, the BBC broadcast Oz and James's Big Wine Adventure, a series in which May, a committed bitter drinker, traveled around France with wine expert Oz Clarke. A second series was transmitted in late 2007, this time with May and Clark in the Californian wine country, and was followed by a third series in 2009 called Oz and James Drink to Britain.  He has also presented a documentary for Sky about sharks called Inside Killer Sharks and a series looking at inventions and discoveries during the twentieth century, entitled James May's 20th Century.  In late 2008, the BBC broadcast James May's Big Ideas, a three-part series in which May traveled around the globe in search of implementations for concepts widely considered science fiction.  In June 2009 May presented a documentary on BBC Two called James May on the Moon commemorating 40 years since man first landed on the moon. This was followed by another documentary on BBC Four called James May at the Edge of Space, where May was flown to the edge of space (70,000 ft) in a Lockheed U-2 spy plane. Highlights of the footage from the training for the flight, and the flight itself was used in James May on The Moon, but was shown fully in this program. This made him the highest flying person, along with the pilot, at that time, after the crew of the International Space Station.  In 2010 Mays was the host of a show named \u201cJames May\u2019s Toy Stories\u201d. In his new show he goes to small towns across Britain and tries to break toy related world records. In the first episodes for example he made a house out of 3 million lego bricks.  Top Gear  Edit  He first co-presented Top Gear in 1999, before it was axed by the BBC owing to poor viewing figures. He rejoined the show in the second series of the present Top Gear format, where he earned the nickname \"Captain Slow\" owing to his \"careful\" driving style. Despite this nickname, he has done some especially high-speed driving, including on Top Gear Series 9 taking a Bugatti Veyron to its top speed of 253 mph (407 km/h) which is nearly one-third of the speed of sound at sea level. He also flew in a Eurofighter Typhoon at a speed of around 1320 mph for his television program, James May's 20th Century. He also became one of the first people - with co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson and an Icelandic support crew - to travel to the magnetic North Pole in a car (a modified Toyota Hilux) even though he was only in the pole because \"the producer said he had to be\", leading to Clarkson saying \"You will be the first person at the North Pole who didn't want to be there\", and also one of the first people to drive across the Makgadikgadi salt pans in Botswana. In Series 16 of Top Gear, May accidentally fell and banged his head whilst on a desert in Syria. Several minutes later, May was taken to hospital due to a bad concusion, leaving Hammond and Clarkson continuing their challenge alone. Though at one point they recieved news that May was recovering well.  In 2015, May declined to renew his Top Gear contract with the BBC, quitting the show he had worked on since 2002 following lead presenter Jeremy Clarkson's dismissal.

{"input": "Context: Venus flytrapThe Venus flytrap (also referred to as Venus's flytrap or Venus' flytrap), Dionaea muscipula, is a carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States in North Carolina and South Carolina.  It catches its prey\u2014chiefly insects and arachnids\u2014with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap closes if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value.  Dionaea is a monotypic genus closely related to the waterwheel plant (Aldrovanda vesiculosa) and sundews (Drosera), all of which belong to the family Droseraceae.  Description  The Venus flytrap is a small plant whose structure can be described as a rosette of four to seven leaves, which arise from a short subterranean stem that is actually a bulb-like object. Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year;  longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering. Flytraps that have more than 7 leaves are colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground.  The leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops;  two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are likely homologous with the tentacles found in this plant\u2019s close relatives, the sundews. Scientists have concluded that the snap trap evolved from a fly-paper trap similar to that of Drosera.   The holes in the meshwork allow small prey to escape, presumably because the benefit that would be obtained from them would be less than the cost of digesting them. If the prey is too small and escapes, the trap will usually reopen within 12 hours. If the prey moves around in the trap, it tightens and digestion begins more quickly.  Speed of closing can vary depending on the amount of humidity, light, size of prey, and general growing conditions. The speed with which traps close can be used as an indicator of a plant's general health. Venus flytraps are not as humidity-dependent as are some other carnivorous plants, such as Nepenthes, Cephalotus, most Heliamphora, and some Drosera.  The Venus flytrap exhibits variations in petiole shape and length and whether the leaf lies flat on the ground or extends up at an angle of about 40\u201360 degrees. The four major forms are: 'typica', the most common, with broad decumbent petioles; 'erecta', with leaves at a 45-degree angle; 'linearis', with narrow petioles and leaves at 45 degrees; and 'filiformis', with extremely narrow or linear petioles. Except for 'filiformis', all of these can be stages in leaf production of any plant depending on season (decumbent in summer versus short versus semi-erect in spring), length of photoperiod (long petioles in spring versus short in summer), and intensity of light (wide petioles in low light intensity versus narrow in brighter light).

The swimmer, who became a sensation in Beijing when she won two gold medals at the age of 13, successfully defended one of the two titles she won four years ago by winning the S6 400m freestyle race.  Her record-breaking swim saw one of many world records obliterated at this Paralympic Games, already looking like the most competitive in the history of disability sport.  Ireland's Jason Smyth last night proved that he was still the fastest Paralympian on the planet, running the T13 100m in a record-breaking 10.46 seconds. In the Velodrome, Great Britain's Sarah Storey also set a world record to take her second medal of the Games in the C4-5 500m time trial. In the Olympic Stadium, Richard Whitehead smashed his own world record in the T42 men's 200m, claiming gold in a time of 24.38 seconds, shaving six-tenths of a second off the time of 24.93 seconds he had set at the European Championships in the Netherlands in June.  The dressage rider Natasha Baker also broke records, taking gold in her Paralympic debut in the grade II individual equestrian event, with a score of 76.857 per cent.  The third day of the Games saw a slew of medals for Great Britain, as the home nation leapt briefly to second in the medal table. But a tally of five golds, five silvers and six bronzes was not enough to hold back the Australian team, which took a rash of awards to take second place.  Even this failed to diminish the euphoria after Simmonds finished first in a time of five minutes 19.17 seconds to claim one of three medals for ParalympicsGB.  Last night at the Aquatics Centre, she shaved a massive five seconds off the previous world record of 5:24.46, set by the American swimmer Victoria Arlen in June.  The 17-year-old from the US was viewed as Simmonds's biggest rival before the race and so it proved to be. Arlen finished what turned out to be a nail-biting encounter in second place with a time of 5:20.18. It was the American who touched first at 200m, enjoying a slight lead over the home favourite, and she continued to hold a slight advantage at the 300m mark. But Simmonds fought back over the next 50m to take the lead after 350m, and stretched her advantage over the final 50m.  \"I'm so pleased to touch and get a world record and a five second personal best,\" said Simmonds. \"I knew it was going to be so tough leading into it with Victoria being on form and I knew I had to give it my everything and give it my all. That last 50 hurt, it just killed me.\" She described the event as \"one of the toughest races of my life so far\".  There had been some doubt whether Arlen would be able to swim against the 17-year-old Briton yesterday, as earlier in the week the American had been ruled ineligible to compete as her impairment was not deemed severe enough. After the US Paralympic Committee made a protest, the appeal was upheld.  Simmonds, who was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, had comfortably qualified for last night's final in the morning, in her first appearance of the Games, beating her own Paralympic record with a new time of 5:24.64 in the first heat.  Her quest for London 2012 gold was one of the British public's most awaited events of the Paralympics.

Ekstrand,   President of the   Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , on June 1, 1920 *  Ladies and Gentlemen. **  The Royal Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Nobel   Prize for Physics, for the year 1918, to Geheimrat Dr. Max   Planck, professor at Berlin University, for his work on the   establishment and development of the theory of elementary   quanta.  From the time that Kirchhoff enunciated the principle \"that the   intensity of radiation from a black body is dependent only upon   the wavelength of the radiation and the temperature of the   radiating body, a relationship worth while investigation\", the   theoretical treatment of the radiation problem has provided a   rich, fertile source of fresh discoveries. It is only necessary   here to recall the fertile Doppler principle, and further, the   transformation of our - concept of the nature of light as seen   now in the electromagnetic theory of light formulated by that   great man, Maxwell, the deduction of Stefan's Law by Boltzmann,   and Wien's Law of Radiation. Since it was clear, however, that   this did not correspond exactly with the reality, but was rather,   like a radiation law propounded by Lord Rayleigh , only a special case of   the general radiation law, Planck sought for, and in 1900 found,   a mathematical formula for the latter, which he derived   theoretically later on. The formula contained two constants; one,   as was demonstrated, gave the number of molecules in a gram   molecule of matter. Planck was also the first to succeed in   getting, by means of the said relation, a highly accurate value   for the number in question, the so-called Avogadro constant. The   other constant, the so-called Planck constant, proved, as it   turned out, to be of still greater significance, perhaps, than   the first. The product hv, where v is the frequency   of vibration of a radiation, is actually the smallest amount of   heat which can be radiated at the vibration frequency v.   This theoretical conclusion stands in very sharp opposition to   our earlier concept of the radiation phenomenon. Experience had   to provide powerful confirmation, therefore, before Planck's   radiation theory could be accepted. In the meantime this theory   has had unheard-of success. The specific heat of substances,   Stokes' Law for phosphorescence and fluorescence phenomena and   the photoelectric effect provide, as Einstein has first suggested, most   powerful support for Planck's radiation theory as against the   older, usual concept. A still greater triumph was enjoyed by   Planck's theory in the field of spectral analysis, where Bohr's basic work, the work of   Sommerfeld and Epstein, and other complementary efforts provided   an explanation for the enigmatic laws ruling within this part of   science. Recently, basic physico-chemical phenomena, such as the   effect of temperature upon speed of reaction and the heat of   reaction, have also had a new light shed upon them as a result of   the work of W.C. McCullagh, Lewis, Perrin and others, using Planck's   theory.  Planck's radiation theory is, in truth, the most significant   lodestar for modern physical research, and it seems that it will   be a long time before the treasures will be exhausted which have   been unearthed as a result of Planck's genius.  \u00a0  Professor Planck. The Swedish Academy of   Sciences has awarded you the Nobel Prize for 1918 in recognition   of your epoch-making investigations into the quantum theory. This   theory, which was originally connected with black-body radiation,   has now demonstrated its validity for other fields and   relationships of Nature, and the constant number, named after   you, is a proportionality factor which describes a common, but   until now unknown, property of matter.

She is the winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award. She is also the recipient of three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America and four Gold Daggers from Great Britain\u2019s Crime Writers Association. In 1997, she was named a life peer in the House of Lords. Ruth Rendell also writes mysteries under the name of Barbara Vine, of which A Dark Adapted Eye is the most famous. She lives in England.  Sign me up for news about Ruth Rendell  Books by Ruth Rendell  Ruth Rendell Biography - The Best Mystery Books and MoviesRuth Rendell Biography  Ruth\u00a0Rendell biography  Ruth Rendell  (1930 - )  Ruth Barbara Rendell, Baroness Rendell of Babergh, CBE, (born 17 February 1930), who also writes under the pseudonym Barbara Vine, is an English crime writer, author of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries.  In addition to police procedurals starring her most iconic creation, Chief Inspector Wexford, Rendell writes psychological crime novels exploring such themes as romantic obsession, misperceived communication, the impact of chance and coincidence, and the humanity of the criminals involved. Among such books are A Judgement In Stone, The Face of Trespass, Live Flesh, Talking to Strange Men, The Killing Doll, Going Wrong and Adam and Eve and Pinch Me. Many credit her and close friend P. D. James for upgrading the entire genre of whodunit, shaping it more into a whydunit. Rendell's protagonists are often socially isolated, suffer from mental illness, and/or are otherwise disadvantaged; she explores the adverse impacts of their circumstances on these characters as well as on their victims.  Rendell created a third strand of writing with the publication in 1986 of A Dark-Adapted Eye under her pseudonym Barbara Vine (the name derives from her own middle name and her grandmother's maiden name). King Solomon's Carpet, A Fatal Inversion and Asta's Book (alternative US title, Anna's Book), among others, inhabit the same territory as her psychological crime novels while further developing themes of human misunderstandings and the unintended consequences of family secrets and hidden crimes. Rendell is famous for her elegant prose and sharp insights into the human mind, as well as her ability to create cogent plots and characters. Rendell has also injected the social changes of the last 40 years into her work, bringing awareness to such issues as domestic violence and the change in the status of women.  Rendell has received many awards for her writing, including the Silver, Gold, and Cartier Diamond Daggers from the Crime Writers' Association, three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America, The Arts Council National Book Awards, and The Sunday Times Literary Award. A number of her works have been adapted for film or television.

The store is of very impressive dimensions and there are more than 330 different departments within that cover more than one million square feet of floor. Several of the departments within the store are world famous.  History of the Store  Harrods was founded by Charles Henry Harrod back in 1824 when he was just 25 years old. The original location was in Southwalk, where the business was a haberdashery, drapery and merchant. He ran the business here until 1831, and in 1832 he opened the first Harrods grocer in Clerkenwell. Then in 1834 he opened a grocer in the east end of London where he specialized in wholesale and particularly in tea. Then in 1849 Harrod took over a shop in Brompton, on the site where the store stands today. The business started off with two employees, but by 1880 he was already employing an astounding one hundred people.  Fire of 1883  In 1883 tragedy struck and the store burned to the ground. However, even after this reversal of fortune, Harrod remained committed to his customers and made all the Christmas deliveries he had on order that year. He also rebuilt the business, making a new building on the same site. Once the new store was complete, the network of customers he had started to expand rapidly and soon included many famous names such as Oscar Wilde and Charlie Chaplin. In 1898, Harrod introduced the very first escalator in a department store.  Ownership of Harrods  In 1985, the Fayed brothers purchased the store, and then in 2010 rumors began to spread that the department store was up for sale once again. After denial from Al Fayed that Harrods was indeed for sale, it was purchased by Quatar Holdings in 2010. The deal was finalized on May 8th with a visit to London by the Prime Minister of Quatar. The sale price was 1.5 billion pounds, with half of the amount used up in paying bank debts. Al Fayed ensured his customers that the traditions of Harrods and the legacy would not be lost with the sale.  Services and Products  Within the 330 different departments of the store there are many services and products. There are departments for clothing, jewelry, electronics, sports, pets, food, toys, furniture, home appliances and furnishings, and many more. You can also take advantage of a personal shopping service by appointment and take refreshments in an astounding 32 different restaurants within the store. You can also locate a pharmacy, barbers, watch repair, tailor, and a beauty salon within Harrods.  Other services include food delivery, hampers for picnics, bespoke fragrances and cakes and event planning. It is estimated that up to an amazing 300,000 customers will visit the store on busy days. A large proportion of the customer are non English speaking. Within the store there are over 5,000 staff members from more than 50 countries around the globe.

{"input": "Context: Benjamin Disraeli - epubBooksBenjamin Disraeli  Tweet  Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, KG, PC, FRS, was a British Conservative politician, writer, aristocrat and dandy who twice served as Prime Minister. He played a central role in the creation of the modern Conservative Party, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal spokesman William Ewart Gladstone, and his one-nation conservatism or \u201cTory democracy\u201d. He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the British Empire. He is to date the only British Prime Minister of Jewish birth.  In the 1840s Disraeli wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With Coningsby; or, The New Generation (1844), Disraeli, in Blake\u2019s view, \u201cinfused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that England\u2019s future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians.\u201d Coningsby was followed by Sybil; or, The Two Nations (1845), another political novel, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than Coningsby; the \u201ctwo nations\u201d of its sub-title referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived working classes.

As the director revealed in a new post-screening \u00a0Q&A\u00a0with Christopher Nolan at LA\u2019s\u00a0DGA Theater, however, not all the music Morricone contributed to the film was actually written for it.  \u201cI had a little voice in my head saying, \u2018This material deserved an original score.\u2019 And I\u2019ve never thought that way before, I\u2019ve never had that voice before. I didn\u2019t ever want to trust a composer with the soul of my movie,\u201d Tarantino said about making the choice to reach out to Morricone. Unfortunately,\u00a0it became clear during their first meeting together that the composer wouldn\u2019t have time to write a complete score. Tarantino had already shot the film, and would need the music in just a month\u2019s time. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018This is not going to work. I\u2019m working with Giuseppe Tornatore, and he just finished shooting the other day, and I\u2019ve got to do his score, this is not going to work. I was told a lot of things that weren\u2019t correct, and I\u2019m really sorry.'\u201d  But the director was taken by Morricone\u2019s pitch for the feel of the theme, so he suggested using music from Morricone\u2019s classic score to John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing. It turned out this was an incredibly viable idea, as much of the music written for\u00a0The Thing never ended up in the film. It was released on\u00a0a now-out-of-print soundtrack, but that was it. \u201c\u2026\u2019I wrote a whole orchestra score [for The Thing], and I wrote a whole synthesizer score, because I knew that was what [John Carpenter] was used to,\u201d Tarantino\u00a0said, parapraphsing Morricone, \u201cand I gave him everything, and the only thing he used in the entire movie was the synthesizer main title [track].\u2019 So basically, if you stay away from the synthesizer main title, all that music that\u2019s on the soundtrack album has never been used in a movie ever. So, he goes, \u2018What I can do is I\u2019ll write the theme\u2026 and with the other Thing\u00a0pieces of music, now you have your original score that\u2019s never been used in a movie before.'\u201d  Morricone ended up being so inspired by The Hateful Eight that he composed a total of 25 minutes of new music for the film as opposed to the original ten-minute theme track. \u201cAnd so with that,\u201d Tarantino said, \u201cand the unused Thing\u00a0portions that I used, [I\u2019ve got] my original score.\u201d  It\u2019s quite possible that this means Morricone\u2019s score will be ineligible for an Oscar, as not all the music qualifies as \u201coriginal\u201d for the film. Still, for film\u00a0and score aficionados, it\u2019s a fascinating revelation to learn that unused music from a horror classic will now live on in a violent modern Western.

The new collection went down in fashion history as the \"New Look\" after Harpar\u2019s Bazaar editor-in-chief Carmel exclamation, \"It's such a New Look!\"  During World War II, designers and clothes makers had been forced to adjust their styles to wartime cloth restrictions and rationing due to lack of materials; women's clothes were close fitting, with square shoulders and shorter skirts. Though clothing restrictions were still in effect in France, UK and the US in 1947, Dior's New Look collection violated all the rules of wartime fashion: his outfits had rounded shoulders, full skirts and a narrow waist. The dresses were lined with expensive and luxurious fabrics such as cambric or taffeta and were beautifully detailed. Outfits were accessorized with a hat, often worn to one side, long gloves and simple jewelry.

Critics scolded the designer for ignoring the continued rationing and the economic distress of the war years. They complained that manufacturers didn't have enough cloth to make Dior's full skirts and that women didn't have enough money to buy them. One British politician claimed that the longer skirt was the \"ridiculous whim of idle people,\" while protestors in Paris called out, \"40,000 francs for a dress and our children have no milk,\" according to Nigel Cawthorne, author of The New Look: The Dior Revolution. But women and other designers disagreed. The first women to see the designs at Paris fashion shows raved that femininity had returned to women's clothes.

Though clothing restrictions were still in       effect in France, Great Britain, and the United States in 1947,       Dior's New Look collection violated all the rules of wartime       fashion: his outfits had rounded shoulders; full, billowing skirts; and a       narrow waist. The dresses were lined with expensive and luxurious fabrics       such as cambric or taffeta and were beautifully detailed. Outfits were       accessorized with a hat, often worn to one side, long gloves, and simple       jewelry.

A:  Quick Answer  Blue litmus paper remains blue when contacted by an alkaline solution, while red litmus paper turns blue. Litmus paper may also be used to determine the acidity and neutrality of a solution.  Full Answer  Litmus is a dye composed of several different lichens in a powder form that easily dissolves into water. It is typically more chemically reactive when applied to filter paper. When used to determine the acidity of a solution, red litmus paper remains red, while blue litmus paper turns red. If the solution is neutral, both colors of litmus paper retain their original color. Litmus may be dissolved directly into a solution to determine its alkalinity or acidity.  What color does litmus paper turn in acid? | Reference.comWhat color does litmus paper turn in acid? | Reference.com  What color does litmus paper turn in acid?  A:  Quick Answer  When blue litmus paper is dipped in an acid, it turns red; when red litmus paper is dipped in an acid, it just appears to get wet. Alkacid paper, which is a universal indicator, turns orange or red when it is reacting to an acid, with a redder color indicating a lower pH and a stronger level of acidity.

BBC - KS3 Bitesize Science - Acids, bases and metals ...BBC - KS3 Bitesize Science - Acids, bases and metals : Revision, Page 4  Acids, bases and metals  Next  Indicators and the pH scale  When an acid is dissolved in water we get an acidic solution, and alkalis make alkaline solutions. If a solution is neither acidic nor alkaline we call it neutral. Pure water is neutral, and so is paraffin.  Indicators are substances that change colour when they are added to acidic or alkaline solutions. You can prepare homemade indicators from red cabbage or beetroot juice - these will help you see if a solution is acidic or alkaline.  Litmus and universal indicator are two indicators that are commonly used in the laboratory.  Litmus  Litmus indicator solution turns red in acidic solutions and blue in alkaline solutions - and it turns purple in neutral solutions.  Litmus paper is usually more reliable, and comes as red litmus paper and blue litmus paper. The table shows the colour changes it can make.  \u00a0  Turns blue  Stays blue  Notice how we say 'stays red'. This is better than saying 'nothing' or 'stayed the same', because it tells us the colour we actually see.  Acids turn blue litmus paper red  Alkalis turn red litmus paper blue  Universal indicator and the pH scale  Universal indicator is a mixture of several different indicators. Unlike litmus, universal indicator can show us exactly how strongly acidic or alkaline a solution is. This is measured using the pH scale. The pH scale runs from pH 0 to pH 14.  Universal indicator has many different colour changes, from red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. In the middle, neutral pH 7 is indicated by green.  Universal indicator shows how acidic or alkaline a solution is  These are the important points about the pH scale:  neutral solutions are pH 7 exactly  acidic solutions have pH values less than 7  alkaline solutions have pH values more | Question: An alkali turns red litmus paper what colour/color?", "truth": ["blue"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2193", "mistake": "blue", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Background  Born:  1912  Affiliation:  University  of  Chicago, Chicago,  IL  Book Store  Who Deserved the Nobel Prize? | Foundation for Economic ...Who Deserved the Nobel Prize? | Foundation for Economic Education  Who Deserved the Nobel Prize?  Mark Skousen  Monday, April 01, 1996  \u201cPrizes shall be awarded to those persons who during the previous year have rendered the greatest service to mankind.\u201d  \u2014Alfred Nobel\u2019s last will (1895)  Since 1969, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science has been awarded to more than two dozen eminent economists, including Paul Samuelson, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, James Tobin, and Robert Solow. Last year the winner was Robert Lucas, the Chicago economist who developed the rational expectations theory.  Lucas\u2019s winning the Nobel Prize reflects the growing dominance of free-market economics in the profession. In fact, economists from the University of Chicago received the award in five of the past six years. The prize, established by the Bank of Sweden, is awarded by a six-man committee, headed by Assar Lindbeck, who has gradually grown more conservative over time. Economist Robert Kuttner bemoans the fact that several prominent Keynesians were ignored by the Nobel committee during their lifetimes: Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, and Sir Roy Harrod (Business Week, November 12, 1990).  Are there any free-market economists who failed to receive the Nobel Prize? I asked several colleagues to name their favorite deceased economist who was still alive in 1969, why that economist deserved the award, and what major works should be cited. Their choices were as follows.  Ludwig von Mises  Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973), the pre-eminent Austrian economist, was everyone\u2019s first choice. Of his many original contributions, three stand out: the theory of the business cycle, the socialist calculation debate, and methodology. Most important works: Theory of Money and Credit (1912), Socialism (1922), and Human Action (1949, 1966).  Murray N. Rothbard  Murray N. Rothbard (1926-1995), the libertarian iconoclast who popularized Misesian economics in America, was nearly everyone\u2019s second choice. He made original contributions in welfare economics and monopoly and tax theory, but was best known for his remarkable ability to write clearly and profoundly about money, business cycles, and government policy. Major works: Man, Economy and State (1962), America\u2019s Great Depression (1963), and Power and Market (1970). His booklet What Has the Government Done to Our Money? has probably had the greatest influence of all. Several colleagues also mentioned his last great work, a two-volume history, Economic Thought Before Adam Smith and Classical Economics (Edward Elgar, 1995).  W. H. Hutt  William H. Hutt (1899-1988), a classical economist who for half a century taught at the University of Cape Town, was frequently mentioned as a third candidate. Hutt\u2019s major contribution was in labor economics, wherein he argued that persistent unemployment was due to above-market wage rates imposed by government regulations. He was a long-time critic of Keynesian economics and apartheid in South Africa. Major works: The Theory of Idle Resources (1939), Keynesianism: Retrospect and Prospect (1963), and Economics of the Colour Bar (1964).  My fellow economists also recommended several other names: Oskar Morgenstern for his Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944, co-authored by John von Neumann) and On the Accuracy of Economic Observations (1950); Gottfried Haberler for his Prosperity and Depression (1937) and his exposition of the Austrian theory of the trade cycle; Frank Knight for his Risk, Uncertainty and Profit (1921); Jacob Viner for his history of economic thought | Question: Which 1976 Nobel laureate popularised Monetarist theory?", "truth": ["milton friedman"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1378", "mistake": "Milton Friedman", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

The acclaimed thriller, which began with the discovery of a body in the middle of the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden, returns to the spectacular crossing for the beginning of series two.  Set 13 months later, the events of the first series, which ended in fury, grief, betrayal and a gut-wrenching final twist, are not left entirely behind.  Its star Sofia Helin, who plays straight-talking Malmo murder detective Saga Noren, said: \"I was annoyed because the ending was so dark, I thought no one will want to see the second season. I was so upset.\" She need not have worried. The Swedish-Danish co-production has proved hugely influential and will return for a third series.  Sold to more than 130 countries, it was remade in the US and adapted by Broadchurch producer Kudos, in a rare UK-French co-production, as The Tunnel, which came to an end last month, after general acclaim, on Sky Atlantic.  All three Scandinavian dramas have one thing in common \u2013 strong female lead characters \u2013 which led actor Anna Chancellor, who starred in BBC2's The Hour, to complain that UK commissioning editors had not followed their lead .  Helin said she hoped her role and the success of the drama could set a positive example for others. \"If you are not a feminist, you are stupid,\" she said.  While Helin's character appeared to show aspects of Asperger syndrome in the first series, it was never made explicit. The second season, which reunites Noren with Copenhagen detective Martin Rohde, played by Kim Bodnia, returns to the topic. \"To begin with it was very hard because she is so different from me,\" said Helin. \"I enjoyed being her but she is a very lonely person. The obvious choice would have been to try to make her hard or cold, but to me that wasn't interesting. It was interesting to see her struggling with her difficulties and her way of being, how she related to situations and people around her.\"  She added: \"I could sense when I read the script that she was different, that she didn't have so much empathy, and I started to study Asperger's and to try to behave the way I thought an Asperger's person would behave.\"  The show's haunting theme tune is back , as is its sense of humour, much of it generated by the \"odd couple\" relationship between the mismatched detectives.

Immaculately clad in Armani suits, the quartet have since sold 22 million albums, topped the charts in 26 countries and sung at the opening and closing ceremonies of the last World Cup.  They are, in short, a classical supergroup to rival The Three Tenors, and their infamous Svengali is rightly proud of all that has been achieved.

They now have such self-belief that they are prepared to stand up to Cowell, a demanding mentor who coldly humiliates wannabe singing stars every Saturday on The X Factor.  'In the beginning, Simon Cowell was involved in everything we did,' says Carlos Marin, Il Divo's dark, excitable Spanish baritone. 'He said to us: \"Trust me\"\u00a0 -\u00a0 and we did. Now it's the other way around. We say to him: \"Trust us\"\u00a0 -\u00a0 and he does.  'We've shown him we know what we're doing. Simon still has the final say on certain aspects of the group, but we sit down and discuss things together. He's famous for being tough with people on The X Factor, but he isn't tough with us.'  Frenchman Sebastien Izambard, the only member of Il Divo with no formal classical training, nods in agreement. 'Simon plays a character when he is on TV,' he says.  'But he's different with us. He had to work hard to find the four of us. He auditioned singers in 17 countries. But then, having found the right people, he knew he could trust us.  'Some people still get confused by Il Divo. They think we came from a reality TV show, but we didn't. We've always been professional singers. And, in that sense, we have a very different relationship with Simon. It's not like The X Factor.'  For the group, whose name means 'divine male performer' in Italian, commercial success arrived quickly.  Svengali: The group are now prepared to stand up to Simon Cowell  Early attempts to shape them into a mature boyband were shelved by Cowell after they struggled with the dance routines in rehearsals.  And while their songs were pop-orientated rather than strictly operatic, they also looked uncomfortable when asked to shoot a promo video in jeans and T-shirts.  When that first batch of sharp Italian designer suits arrived, though, the band and Cowell realised they now had the look to match the music.  'The other stuff we tried just wasn't right,' says Carlos. 'But the Armani suits fitted perfectly.'  While the group's debut album, 2004's Il Divo, topped the UK charts, supplanting Robbie Williams, the relationships within the quartet took longer to gel.  Even as their two subsequent albums, Ancora and Siempre, made major inroads in America, there was still little genuine camaraderie within the ranks.  As recently as last year, Swiss tenor Urs Buhler confessed that the group 'were never going to be best friends'.  Today, however, as the quartet (this time minus the suits) chat over breakfast in London's Soho Hotel, they're singing a different tune.

{"input": "Context: The Difference Between One-Hump and Two-Hump CamelsThe Difference Between One-Hump and Two-Hump Camels  The Difference Between One-Hump and Two-Hump Camels  Advertisement  For years scientists believed that camels - like unicorns, mermaids, and the American Indian - were just a mythical creature used to market cigarettes.  That was until scientists discovered the existence of real-life camels in the Egyptian desert in 1967.  But seriously speaking, there are three types of camels, which are one-hump camels, two-hump camels, and camel cigarettes.  I am only going to address the first two types.  Dromedary is the name for one-hump camels.  This type of camel is common to Africa and the Middle East.  It was exported all over the world and is now relatively common in Australia and North America, where is has been used sporadically over the years as a pack animal.  Dromedary camels are much more common than two hump camels and much less common than camel cigarettes.  Bactrian Camels are much less common than dromedary (one-hump).  Bactrian camels are native to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia.  Aside from the obvious difference of the number of humps, Bactrian Camels differ in a few other key ways.  For example, the Bactrian camel grows a thick coat of hair each winter.  That coat of hair falls off every spring.  This is to deal with the extreme variation of temperature in the Gobi desert where summer highs often top 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and winter months can see significant amounts of snow.  In general, Bactrian camels are much more mild-mannered than their hot-tempered dromedary kin.  (The Dromedary camel has a uniform length of hair year round.)  Estimates for the number of Bactrian Camels in North America range from about 400-800 head.  It is possible to cross breed the two types of camels.  Some people would expect that by breeding a one-hump camel with a two-hump camel that the result might be a three hump camel.  The actual math equation is closer to this: one-hump camel + two-hump camel=a camel with one really large hump.  Due to lower numbers, and the higher regard in the eyes of breeders, Bactrian camels command much higher prices than Dromedary camels.  by Cameron Hatch  The Camel, Dromedary (One Hump) and Bactrian (Two Humps ...The Camel, Dromedary (One Hump) and Bactrian (Two Humps) - DesertUSA  Bactrian camel (two-humps, endangered): Camelus bactrianus  Description  A tall desert-dwelling creature, the camel has become an icon   of the Asian and African deserts. Generally the camel is a pleasant animal. If   well treated, the domestic camel is very docile and easy to manage. If ill-treated,   they can become very stubborn. Camels can easily be identified by the unique   one or two humps on their back and their long necks.  Range  Dry desert areas of southwestern Asia, the Sahara Desert in North Africa   and along the Arabian Peninsula in the Middle East and Indian desert areas. There   is a large feral population of dromedary camels in the Australian outback.  Physical Characteristics  Height: 6' at shoulder , 7' at hump  Weight: 500 to 1500 lbs  Body length: approx. 10'  When running, a camel can reach a speed up to 40 mph in short bursts, 25 mph   for longer periods of time. Camels do not have hooves. The foot of a camel is   made up of a large leathery pad, with  two toes at the front, the bones of which   are embedded in the foot. The padding makes the gait of a camel silent, and   keeps it from sinking in the sand. The camel also has pads of    thick leathery skin, on its leg joints, enabling it to kneel or lay   in the hot sand.

And the fact that it has been named after St Jude - the patron saint of lost causes - isn't exactly reassuring.  We've been told to expect winds of up to 90mph, torrential rain, travel chaos and possible disruptions to the power supply , so perhaps we should start to despair.  But Monday also happens to be the feast day for this particular saint, so it might not be all bad news.  So who was St Jude? Here are the 10 things you need to know about the patron saint of lost causes and desperate cases...  1. St Jude was one of Jesus' 12 apostles, chosen to spread the word of the gospel.  2. He was also known as Thaddeus or Thaddaeus - said to be a surname for the name Labbaeus which means \"heart\" or courageous\".  3. He is believed to have written the book of Jude. Religious scholars say it contains some of the finest expressions of praise to God in the Bible's New Testament.  4. Jude became associated with desperate situations because of a letter he wrote to the Churches of the East. In it he says that the faithful must keep going even in harsh or difficult circumstances.  5. He is thought to have been martyred in Beirut in around 65 AD, along with fellow apostle Simon the Zealot. He is often depicted showing a club or axe, symbolising the way he died.  6. He is also sometimes pictured with a flame above his head. This refers to the Pentecost, where he and the other apostles received the Holy Spirit.  7. The personal ads sections of some newspapers occasionally include messages from people calling on St Jude for help in times of need, or thanking him for his support and guidance.  8. Some choose to carry the image of St Jude on a medal or as a pendant on a necklace to provide comfort.  9. The Shrine of St Jude can be found at the parish church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Faversham, Kent. It was set up in the 1950s by the church's friars, who noticed they were getting an increasing number of requests for St Jude prayer cards. Donations to \"The Shrine of St Jude\" began to come in, but one didn't exist - so Friar Elias Lynch set one up. The shrine is visited all year round, but particularly on St Jude's feast day - October 28.  10. St Jude is not to be confused with Judas Iscariot - another of the 12 apostles, but the one who betrayed Jesus.

Dressed in green and white Biblical-era clothing -- for he was one of the Disciples of Jesus -- he is distinguished by the fact that he often wears and holds a golden metal pendant of the type carried by people seeking his aid. Additionally, in some images of Saint Jude, there is a small flame atop his head, signifying the Baptism by Fire (also known as the Baptism of the Holy Ghost) which was received by the Disciples of Jesus at Pentecost. | Question: Who is the patron saint of lost causes?", "truth": ["st jude", "patron saint of lost causes", "thaddaeus", "saint jude"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-347", "mistake": "St Jude", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Based on the first four Poldark novels by the late Winston Graham, the series starred Robin Ellis as Ross Poldark, an 18th century British army officer who returns home to Cornwall from the American Revolutionary War to find his personal life in shambles and his family business on the point of ruin. The rugged yet beautiful Cornish scenery coupled with well-written scripts, colorful characters (including one or two who you just loved to hate) and flawless performances made Poldark an instant hit on this side of the pond as well as around the world.  Having previously released seasons one and two of the Emmy and BAFTA-nominated series as separate 4-volume boxed DVD sets, Acorn Media ( www.AcornOnline.com ) recently released a value-priced 8-disc DVD collection of both seasons. This foil-packaged collector\u2019s edition includes all 29 episodes of the BBC series in addition to the bonus features \u201cGetting the Part\u201d by Poldark star Robin Ellis, excerpted from his book, Making Poldark, along with cast filmographies and historical background on Cornwall.  Prior to Poldark, Ellis had been busy honing his craft onstage with roles including Achilles in Troilus and Cressida, Edmund in King Lear and Dr. Pinch in The Comedy of Errors, as well as with appearances on such popular British TV series as\u00a0Elizabeth R, The Moonstone, Sense and Sensibility and Blue Remembered Hills. Fans will also recall the actor\u2019s guest-starring role as undercover police officer Danny Brown in the Fawlty Towers episode \u201cA Touch of Class.\u201d  \u201cAt one point I had to speak fluent Spanish to the now very famous Spanish waiter, Manuel [played by Andrew Sachs],\u201d recalls Ellis. \u201cWhen we did it in front of the audience that Sunday night, I got it all right.\u00a0Immediately afterwards, however, the stage manager came up to me and said, \u2018I\u2019m very sorry, Robin, but there\u2019s something wrong with the camera and we have to do it all over again.\u2019 My palms were already bleeding from tension, and I had to do it all over again,\u201d he says with a chuckle.  \u201cIt was wonderful to have been in the first episode of Fawlty Towers, one of the very great pieces of television comedy I think in the world.\u201d  When it comes to Poldark, Ellis originally interviewed twice for the role of Ross, and on his third meeting he read for the show\u2019s producer and director. That was on a Friday, and the following Monday\u00a0the actor\u00a0was told that the part was his. \u201cIt was agony waiting to hear,\u201d he notes, \u201cbecause by then I really wanted to do it.\u201d  Wounded and having escaped from a French prison camp, Ross is relieved to once again see his familiar Cornish surroundings, but any joy is short-lived. He not only learns of his father death, but finds his home and property run down. With everyone having assumed him dead, the former solider also discovers that the woman he loved, Elizabeth (Jill Townsend), is engaged to his cousin Francis (Clive Francis). Meanwhile, a wealthy local family, the Warleggens, is pushing to buy the Poldark family copper mines. Thanks to a young woman named Demelza (Angharad Rees), our hero is eventually able to feel love once again, but his personal as well as professional struggles are far from over.  \u201cRoss fits very much into a tradition of that sort of writing,\u201d explains Ellis. \u201cCertainly in the first series it\u2019s a rags-to-riches story in a sense.

{"input": "Context: Gamay Wine InformationGamay Wine Information  Gamay  \u00a0 Gamay Wine  Gamay (Gamay Noir \u00e0 Jus Blanc in full) is a grape variety that is most famous for producing the light, fruit-driven red wines of Beaujolais . While the variety offers fresh, red-fruit and candied aromas, it typically delivers little in the way of flavor concentration and body weight, giving light, simple wines. That said, some well-made examples can be deep and complex.  In France, Gamay is planted in the Maconnais , Savoie and around Touraine , but its homeland is Beaujolais. It arrived there (most likely from Germany) in the 14th Century and initially received an unenthusiastic welcome. The ruling dukes of Burgundy even tried to outlaw the variety, distrustful of its unfamiliar taste and texture. Gamay was resigned to the granite-based soils in the hills just north of Lyon, a terroir that it was much better suited to anyway.  Gamay Grapes  Characteristically, Gamay displays flavors of red cherries and strawberries and \u2013 when vinified using the carbonic maceration method \u2013 boiled sweets and banana. This technique is most often employed for what is arguably the most famous expression of the grape:\u00a0 Beaujolais Nouveau , a wine rushed to consumers on the third Thursday of the November immediately following harvest. These light, translucent wines were traditionally made for vineyard workers but in the 1970s and 1980s captured the imagination of wine marketers, who quickly made the wine's release each year into an occasion. Unfortunately, Beaujolais Nouveau is a less-than-sterling expression of the variety and Gamay suffers from a somewhat-tarnished reputation as a result.  Happily, Gamay is currently experiencing a comeback of sorts in the form of some of Beaujolais' other wines, namely those from the 10 villages, or crus, that bear the Beaujolais name. The most famous of these are Moulin-a-Vent , Fleurie and Morgon , although Chiroubles, Julienas and Brouilly all make excellent examples as well. These are usually vinified traditionally and are often aged in oak; the best can age for up to 10 years.  Outside Beaujolais, Gamay is taken most seriously in Switzerland , where it is often blended with Pinot Noir. There are a few examples from Canada, Italy and New Zealand, and the grape is important to the viticultural landscape of Croatia , Kosovo and Serbia .  Until the early 2000s Gamay grown in California was the subject of some confusion and debate; wine in California previously labeled as Gamay was identified as Valdeguie (an uninspiring French variety), while wine labeled as Gamay Beaujolais was found to be a clone of Pinot Noir. Some true Gamay Noir \u00e0 Jus Blanc is planted in California, with the best examples coming from cooler regions at higher altitudes.  Synonyms include: Gamay Noir, Gamay Noir \u00e0 Jus Blanc.  Food matches for Gamay include:  Roast turkey with cranberry sauce  Grilled salmon fillet with roasted fennel  Moroccan lamb tagine with apricot  Last updated 30-Nov-2015  Beaujolais Nouveau | Temecula Valley Winegrowers AssociationBeaujolais Nouveau | Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association  Winermaker\u2019s Roundtable: Five Facts About\u2026Beaujolais Nouveau, + Baily Winery To Release 2011 Cabernet Nouveau  Friday, November 11th, 2011  November 17th marks the third Thursday in November, which is Beaujolais Nouveau Day all around the world. Here\u2019s five facts you may or may have not known about this young wine:  Beaujolais is a red wine made from Gamay grapes- the only grape permitted for this wine- in the Beaujolais region, south of Burgundy, in France.  Beaujolais Nouveau is the new vintage, usually fermented for just six weeks before shipping.  It is generally recommended that Beaujolais Nouveau be drunk no later than the following May after its release, although certain vintages that are considered to be excellent (2009, for example) can be saved much longer.  It is mandated that all of the grapes in the Beaujolais region be picked by hand.  This wine is always released on the third Thursday in November no matter how short the harvest.

He was born Jean Bernadotte, [1] distinguished subsequently from a namesake brother by the addition of Baptiste and had the full name of Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte [2] by the time Carl also was added upon his Swedish adoption in 1810. He did not use Bernadotte in Sweden but founded the royal dynasty there by that name.  French by birth, Bernadotte served a long career in the French Army . He was appointed as a Marshal of France by Napoleon I , though the two had a turbulent relationship. His service to France ended in 1810, when he was elected the heir-presumptive to the Swedish throne because the Swedish royal family was dying out with King Charles XIII .

{"input": "Context: Villa Park | Wiki | Everipedia, the encyclopedia of everythingAston Villa F.C. (1897\u2013present) [2]  Villa Park is a football stadium in Aston , Birmingham , England, with a seating capacity of 42,682. It has been the home of Aston Villa Football Club since 1897. The ground is less than a mile from both Witton and Aston railway stations and has hosted sixteen England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. It was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park has hosted more FA Cup semi-finals than any other stadium, having hosted 55 matches in total.  In 1897, Aston Villa moved into the Aston Lower Grounds, a sports ground in a Victorian amusement park in the former grounds of Aston Hall , a Jacobean stately home. The stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road Stand, North Stand and the Doug Ellis Stand. The club has initial planning permission to redevelop the North Stand, which will increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,682 to approximately 50,000.  Before 1914, a cycling track ran around the perimeter of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield , as Wembley Stadium was unavailable due to it staging the final of the Olympic football tournament . [3]  History  The Aston Lower Grounds, later renamed Villa Park, was not the first home of Aston Villa F.C. Their previous venue, Wellington Road faced increasing problems including an uneven pitch, poor spectator facilities, a lack of access and exorbitant rents. As a result, in 1894, Villa's committee began negotiations with the owners of the Aston Lower Grounds, \"the finest sports ground in the district.\" Situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home, the Lower Grounds had seen varied uses over the years. Originally the kitchen garden of Aston Hall's owner Sir Thomas Holte , the man who gave his name to the Holte End stand, it later became a Victorian amusement park complete with aquarium and great hall. The current pitch stands on the site of the Dovehouse Pool, an ornamental pond drained in 1889. In place of the pool the owners of the Lower Grounds built a cycle track and sports ground that opened on 10 June 1889 for a combined cycling and athletics event that drew an estimated crowd of 15,000. Negotiations continued for two years before the Villa committee reached agreement with the site's owner, Edgar Flower, to rent the Lower Grounds for \u00a3300 per annum on a 21-year lease with an option to buy the site at any point during the term. The committee immediately engaged an architect who began preparing plans for the site, which included construction of a new 440 yards (400 metres) cement cycle track to replace the existing cinder one. The main stand was to be built to the east on the Witton Lane side, with the track and pitch fully enclosed by banking. Construction of the final phase of the stadium began in the winter of 1896 following negotiations with contractors over the price. Several months behind schedule, the almost-complete stadium finally opened on 17 April 1897. The process of fixing issues with the building work would continue for a number of months thereafter. As built, the stadium could house 40,000 spectators, most of whom would stand in the open on the banking. The first match at the ground, a friendly against Blackburn Rovers , took place on 17 April 1897, one week after Aston Villa had completed the League and FA Cup ' Double '.  After winning the league championship in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed the club to invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme.

Ninety years ago, to the day, we saw the first public demonstration of live television.  Scottish engineer, innovator and inventor, John Logie Baird, was one of the inventors of the mechanical television and held the public demonstration of the first working television system on 26 January 1926. The demonstration saw members of the Royal Institution and a special Times journalist gather in his laboratory on 22 Frith Street Soho, to view a small 3.5in by 2in image of a woman standing in a different room.  \u201cThe image transmitted was faint and often blurred, but substantiated a claim that through the \u2018televisor,\u2019 as Baird has named his apparatus, it is possible to transmit and reproduce instantly the details of movement, and such things as the play of expression on the face,\u201d recalled the journalist.  Many historians credit Baird with being the first inventor to produce a live, moving, greyscale television image from reflected light, where other inventors failed.  In the following years, the Baird Television Development Company achieved the first transatlantic television transmission. Following this, he developed the first colour television system and brought out the world\u2019s first mass produced television set in 1929.  When mechanical TV started to fall behind, Baird didn\u2019t give up, but continued to innovate and eventually demonstrated the first fully electronic colour TV in 1944.  Baird dominated TV innovation for three decades, and played a huge part in creating the industry we know today.  DTG Staff \u00a0|\u00a0 26.01.2016  BBC - History - John Logie BairdBBC - History - John Logie Baird  z  John Logie Baird   \u00a0 \u00a9 Baird was a Scottish engineer, most famous for being the first person to demonstrate a working television.  John Logie Baird was born on 14 August 1888 in Helensburgh on the west coast of Scotland, the son of a clergyman. Dogged by ill health for most of his life, he nonetheless showed early signs of ingenuity, rigging up a telephone exchange to connect his bedroom to those of his friends across the street. His studies at the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College were interrupted by the outbreak of World War One. Rejected as unfit for the forces, he served as superintendent engineer of the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company. When the war ended he set himself up in business, with mixed results.  Baird then moved to the south coast of England and applied himself to creating a television, a dream of many scientists for decades. His first crude apparatus was made of odds and ends, but by 1924 he managed to transmit a flickering image across a few feet. On 26 January 1926 he gave the world's first demonstration of true television before 50 scientists in an attic room in central London. In 1927, his television was demonstrated over 438 miles of telephone line between London and Glasgow, and he formed the Baird Television Development Company. (BTDC). In 1928, the BTDC achieved the first transatlantic television transmission between London and New York and the first transmission to a ship in mid-Atlantic. He also gave the first demonstration of both colour and stereoscopic television.  In 1929, the German post office gave him the facilities to develop an experimental television service based on his mechanical system, the only one operable at the time. Sound and vision were initially sent alternately, and only began to be transmitted simultaneously from 1930. However, Baird's mechanical system was rapidly becoming obsolete as electronic systems were developed, chiefly by Marconi-EMI in Britain and America. Although he had invested in the mechanical system in order to achieve early results, Baird had also been exploring electronic systems from an early stage.

Papers filed on behalf of Deborah Rowe Jackson in Los Angeles County Superior Court cited irreconcilable differences. It said the couple had been separated since July 15.  The divorce petition said both parties reached a confidential agreement regarding property and debts. They did not indicate whether a custody agreement had been reached for the couple's children, 2-year-old Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. and 1-year-old Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson.  Jackson and his wife \"mutually agreed to end their marriage,\" spokesman Howard J. Rubenstein said in a statement.  \"Michael and Debbie remain friends, and they ask that the public respect their desire not to further comment or speculate upon the reasons for their decision,\" his statement said.  In a telephone call from New York, he declined to provide other details and said neither Jackson nor his wife would be making any statements.  Rubenstein said he didn't know the whereabouts of the multiplatinum-selling singer, whose hits include \"Thriller\" and \"Billie Jean.\"  Calls to the attorneys representing Jackson and Ms. Rowe were not immediately returned.  At the time, Jackson said: \"Debbie and I love each other for all the things you'll never see on stage or in pictures. ... I fell for the beautiful, unpretentious, giving person that she is, and she fell for me just being me.\"  In April, Jackson told a London tabloid newspaper, The Mirror: \"I love my wife, and we have a happy marriage.\"  Jackson, 41, married Ms. Rowe, a nurse in his plastic surgeon's office, on Nov. 15, 1996, the same year he and Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley, ended their two-year marriage.  In July, Jackson won a lawsuit claiming he violated a settlement stemming from accusations that he molested a 13-year-old boy. An arbitrator entered a judgment in favor of Jackson in a suit filed by the boy's father.  Jackson reached an out-of-court settlement of a molestation lawsuit in 1994. But the father filed another suit in 1996, claiming that his reputation and his son's were harmed when Jackson called the allegation \"lies, lies, lies, lies\" in an interview.  The allegations against Jackson were investigated by authorities in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties, but Jackson was not charged with any crime.  \u00a9 Copyright 1999 The Associated Press  Michael Jackson's Ex-Wife, Debbie Rowe, Could ... - ABC NewsMichael Jackson's Ex-Wife, Debbie Rowe, Could Sue for Kids - ABC News  Email  A custody battle over Michael Jackson's three children may be brewing, and even the King of Pop's will may not determine who would come out on top.  On one side is Katherine Jackson , Jackson's 79-year-old mother, who has been a constant for the singer throughout an often turbulent career and personal life. On the other is Debbie Rowe, Jackson's second wife, who has maintained her distance from the family since divorcing Jackson in 1999. But Rowe maintains parental rights over the two older children.  Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff ruled that, at least for now, Katherine Jackson would get custody of his three children, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., known as Prince Michael, 12; Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, 11; and Prince Michael Jackson II, 7. It's a ruling that Rowe and others could challenge in the future.  Jackson's will, which is expected to be filed in a California court this week, could reveal his last wishes for his children.

Nephew of John and Michael, William\u2019s father Ian is the only brother in the family who doesn\u2019t showjump, but the sport is clearly in William\u2019s blood.  Cousin to Ellen and Robert Whitaker, William grew up surrounded by horses and has competed since he was a child. In 2001 aged 12, William won the Horse of the Year Show 138cm championship on his pony Mystic Starlight Express. Two years later he won the Junior Foxhunter riding Devlin and in 2005 he won the Junior Show Jumper of the Year.  William won individual European gold (and team bronze) as a junior plus team gold and team bronze as a young rider, before stepping up to senior ranks. He also represented Britain in the Australian Youth Olympic Final, riding a borrowed horse, and brought home a bronze medal.  When William left school he trained with American showjumper Aaron Vale, who helped him with the transition from ponies to horses. On his return to England William worked on Michael\u2019s yard. He set up on his own in 2011.  William has a son and a daughter with his girlfriend Elisabeth Fredlund.  William, who is the tallest of the Whitaker family at 6ft1in, has represented Britain in a number of senior Nations Cups. He has won two World Cup qualifiers, the first in Mechelen in 2007, followed by Stuttgart in November 2014.

Born on 5 March 1986, she showed early signs of the Whitaker talent and ambition, competing in her first affiliated show at just five years old, and qualifying for the Horse Of The Year Show by the time she was eight.  She was one of the youngest riders to represent Great Britain when she competed at the European Championships in Germany in 2007, defying her critics to jump triple clear and secure gold for Britain. This win ensured a British presence at the 2008 Bejing Olympics, although Ellen missed out on a place in the team due to her top ride at the time, Holstein stallion Locarno 62, going lame.  Ellen is the winner of numerous prestigious showjumping events including the 2007 and 2010 Hickstead Speed Derby and the 2009 HOYS Puissance. An attractive blonde, Ellen was perceived as bringing a touch of glamour to the sport \u2014 and was engaged to Hollywood actor Henry Cavill for a time \u2014 but in recent years she\u2019s taken a step back from the limelight while she produces her next string of up-and-coming equine superstars.

{"input": "Context: Surrealism - Academic KidsSurrealism - Academic Kids  Surrealism  From Academic Kids  Surrealism is an artistic movement, and an aesthetic philosophy that aims for the liberation of the mind by emphasizing the critical and imaginative powers of the unconscious . Surrealism originated in early 20th century European avant-garde art and literary circles, and many early surrealists had been involved with the Dada movement. An expressly revolutionary movement, surrealism encompassed actions intended to advance radical political, social, cultural and personal change. While surrealism's most important center was in Paris, it spread throughout Europe and to North America in the 1920s , 1930s and 1940s .  The term surreal is also applied more generally to describe the juxtaposition of ordinary events, actions or objects in a manner where the totality does not comport with ordinary sense or social decorum. In this usage it is the successor to the idea of the fantastic in Victorian art and literature.  Contents  6 External links  History of surrealism  Guillaume Apollinaire coined the term surrealism when he described the Jean Cocteau / Erik Satie / Pablo Picasso / L\ufffdonide Massine collaboration Parade ( 1917 ) in the ballet's program notes:  From this new alliance, for until now stage sets and costumes on one side and choreography on the other had only a sham bond between them, there has come about, in 'Parade', a kind of super-realism ('sur-r\ufffdalisme'), in which I see the starting point of a series of manifestations of this new spirit ('esprit nouveau').  Surrealism's founding  Andr\ufffd Breton 's Surrealist Manifesto of 1924 and the publication of the magazine The Surrealist Revolution ( La R\ufffdvolution Surr\ufffdaliste ) mark the beginning of the movement as a public agitation. In the manifesto he defines surrealism as pure psychic automatism with automatism being spontaneous creative production without conscious moral or aesthetic self-censorship. By Breton's admission, as well as by the subsequent development of the movement, this definition lent itself to considerable expansion. Breton also wrote the following dictionary and encyclopedia definitions:  Dictionary: SURREALISM, n. Pure psychic automatism, by which one proposes to express, either verbally, or in writing, or by any other manner, the real functioning of thought. Dictation of thought in the absence of all control exercised by reason, outside of all aesthetic and moral preoccupation.  Encyclopedia: SURREALISM. Philosophy. Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations, in the omnipotence of dream, in the disinterested play of thought. It tends to ruin once and for all all other psychic mechanisms and to substitute itself for them in solving all the principal problems of life.\"  Missing image  Breton and Philippe Soupault wrote the first automatic book , The Magnetic Fields ( Les Champs Magn\ufffdtiques ), in 1919 . Later, Andr\ufffd Masson developed automatic drawing . Automatic drawing and painting , as well as other automatic methods such as decalcomania , frottage , fumage , grattage and parsemage , became significant surrealist techniques. Much later, automatism was adapted to the computer.  By December of 1924, the publication La R\ufffdvolution Surr\ufffdaliste edited by Pierre Naville and Benjamin P\ufffdret , then later by Breton, began distribution. A Bureau of Surrealist Research started in Paris, and was, at one time, under the direction of Antonin Artaud . In 1926, Louis Aragon wrote Paris Peasant ( Le Paysan de Paris ), following the appearance of many surrealist books, poems, pamphlets, automatic texts and theoretical works published by the surrealists, including those by Ren\ufffd Crevel .  Many of the popular artists in Paris throughout the 1920s and 1930s explored surrealism. Among them were Ren\ufffd Magritte , Joan Mir\ufffd , Max Ernst , Salvador Dal\ufffd , Alberto Giacometti , Valentine Hugo , M\ufffdret Oppenheim , Man Ray , Yves Tanguy , Hans Arp , Giorgio de Chirico , and Paul Delvaux .  Games , such as the exquisite corpse , assumed importance in surrealism.

{"input": "Context: George OrwellEric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 \u2013 21 January 1950 ), who used the pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. His work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism.    Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. He is perhaps best known for his dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945). His non-fiction works, including The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England, and Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, are widely acclaimed, as are his essays on politics, literature, language, and culture. In 2008, The Times ranked him second on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".   Orwell's work continues to influence popular and political culture, and the term Orwellian\u2014descriptive of totalitarian or authoritarian social practices\u2014has entered the language together with many of his neologisms, including cold war, Big Brother, thought police, Room 101, memory hole, newspeak, doublethink, and thoughtcrime.   Life  Early years  Eric Arthur Blair was born on 25 June 1903, in Motihari, Bengal Presidency (present-day Bihar), in British India.  His great-grandfather Charles Blair was a wealthy country gentleman in Dorset who married Lady Mary Fane, daughter of the Earl of Westmorland, and had income as an absentee landlord of plantations in Jamaica.  His grandfather, Thomas Richard Arthur Blair, was a clergyman. Although the gentility passed down the generations, the prosperity did not; Eric Blair described his family as \"lower-upper-middle class\".  His father, Richard Walmesley Blair, worked in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service.  His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin), grew up in Moulmein, Burma, where her French father was involved in speculative ventures. Eric had two sisters: Marjorie, five years older, and Avril, five years younger. When Eric was one year old, his mother took him and his older sister to England.Crick (1982), p. 48 His birthplace and ancestral house in Motihari has been declared a protected monument of historical importance.   In 1904, Ida Blair settled with her children at Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. Eric was brought up in the company of his mother and sisters, and apart from a brief visit in mid-1907,  they did not see the husband and father Richard Blair until 1912. His mother's diary from 1905 describes a lively round of social activity and artistic interests.  The family moved to Shiplake before the First World War, where Eric became friendly with the Buddicom family, especially their daughter Jacintha. When they first met, he was standing on his head in a field. On being asked why, he said, \"You are noticed more if you stand on your head than if you are right way up.\"  Jacintha and Eric read and wrote poetry, and dreamed of becoming famous writers. He said that he might write a book in the style of H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia. During this period, he also enjoyed shooting, fishing and birdwatching with Jacintha's brother and sister.  At the age of five, Eric was sent as a day-boy to a convent school in Henley-on-Thames, which Marjorie also attended. It was a Roman Catholic convent run by French Ursuline nuns, who had been exiled from France after religious education was banned in 1903.  His mother wanted him to have a public school education, but his family could not afford the fees, and he needed to earn a scholarship. Ida Blair's brother Charles Limouzin recommended St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex. Limouzin, who was a proficient golfer, knew of the school and its headmaster through the Royal Eastbourne Golf Club, where he won several competitions in 1903 and | Question: Eric Arthur Blair, born 25 June, 1903, was the birth name of what famed English author, who penned such works as The Road To Wiggan Pier and Down and Out in Paris and London?", "truth": ["george orwell", "eric arthur blair", "arthur blair"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7781", "mistake": "George Orwell", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

As hundreds of surviving imperial statues show, there were only three ways in which the emperor could officially be represented: in the battle dress of a general; in a toga, the Roman state civilian costume; or nude, likened to a god. These styles powerfully and effectively evoked the emperor\u2019s role as commander-in-chief, magistrate or priest, and finally as the ultimate embodiment of divine providence.  Hadrian, once a tribune (staff officer) in three different legions of  the Roman army and commander of a legion in one of Trajan\u2019s wars, was often shown in military uniform. He was clearly keen to project the image of an ever-ready soldier, but other conclusions have been drawn from his surviving statues.  A lover of culture  Hadrian was the first Roman emperor to wear a full beard. This has usually been seen as a mark of his devotion to Greece and Greek culture.  One ancient source even calls him graeculus, or \u2018Greekling\u2019. Beards had been a marker of Greek identity since classical times, whereas a clean-shaven look was considered more Roman. However, in the decades before Hadrian became emperor, beards had come to be worn by wealthy young Romans and seem to have been particularly prevalent in the military.  Furthermore, one literary source, the Historia Augusta, claims that Hadrian wore a beard to hide blemishes on his face.  More information about the objects featured here (from top):  Some notes on Beards - beyond-the-pale.co.ukSome notes on Beards  You cannot grow a beard in a moment of passion.  GK Chesterton (1874-1936)  Beard              roots  Bizarre is one of only three English words borrowed from Basque. Tthe other              two are anchovy and Jingo, as in \"By jingo!\",              which derives from Jaincoa, the Basque name for God.  Bizar is Basque for beard and seems to have acquired its current              meaning as a result of swashbuckling, bearded Spanish sailors having              made a powerful impression on the mostly clean-shaven French, for              whom the word came to mean \"to stand out in a crowd\".  Barbados is Portuguese for \"bearded ones\", although this is less              to do with the inhabitants than the thick vines that fringed the island's              trees.  Tragus, the dangly bit of your ear, comes from the Greek tragos meaning a male goat, because the tuft of hair there resembles a goat's              beard.  Frumbierding is an Old English word for a youth, from fruma, meaning \"first\",              making it literally a \"first-bearder\".  In 16th-century            France, the Huguenot Admiral Gaspard de Coligny used his beard            as a toothpick-holder.  Dangerous beards  Alexander            the Great is often credited with starting the fashion for soldiers shaving.            He introduced it as a safety measure because many of his men died in            hand-to-hand combat after their beards were grabbed by their enemies.            This is probably untrue.  A century earlier,            King Tarquin II (535-509 BC) thought beards were unsanitary and brought            the first razor to Rome. Hadrian (76-138 AD) was the first Roman emperor            to sport a beard, allegedly to hide his scarred face. Until then, a            beard meant you were either in mourning - or Greek.  The most treacherous            beard in history was that of Austrian Hans Steininger. It was            more than two metres long and he kept it rolled and stowed in a leather            pouch, but in 1567 he tripped over it while running from a fire, and            perished.

{"input": "Context: Top Five Books \u2014 Authors \u2014 Daniel DefoeTop Five Books \u2014 Authors \u2014 Daniel Defoe  Robinson Crusoe  Daniel Defoe was born around 1660 (the exact date is uncertain) in the parish of St. Giles Cripplegate, London, to Alice and James Foe. His father, James, was a tallow chandler, or candle merchant, and a member of the Butcher's Company, a professional guild. The Foes (Daniel would later change his surname to \"Defoe,\" a more aristocratic name he linked to the De Baux Faux family) were Protestant dissenters, neither following Catholicism nor the official Church of England, and thus a persecuted minority during Great Britain's turbulent seventeenth century.  Defoe lived through a remarkably eventful era, having been born shortly after the death of Oliver Cromwell, and a few years before both the Great Plague (1665) and Great Fire of London (1666). The Foes barely escaped destruction from the fire, and when Daniel was only ten, his mother passed away. Educated at Charles Morton's Academy for dissenters in London, his father expected Defoe to go into the ministry. Not unlike Robinson Crusoe, young Daniel had other ideas and, at the age of eighteen, left school and went into business, eventually becoming a merchant, dealing at various times in hosiery, wool, and wine. He married Mary Tuffley, the daughter of a London merchant, in 1684 and, over a fifty-year marriage, had eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood. It was no doubt a difficult match, as Defoe was constantly in debt and would court disaster with his political activities over the course of his varied career. \"No man,\" he wrote in the preface to the eighth volume of his Review in 1712, \"has tasted differing fortunes more, / And thirteen times I have been rich and poor.\"  Defoe's political intrigues would start off ignominiously, as he supported the Monmouth Rebellion after the death of Charles II, the king who restored the monarchy after the upheaval following Cromwell's death. Charles II, a late convert to Catholicism, had designated his brother, James II, also a Catholic, as his successor, but Charles's bastard son, James Scott, the Duke of Monmouth, was a Protestant and objected to a Catholic king. After his defeat, Monmouth and many of his followers were executed, but Defoe escaped harsh punishment and was eventually pardoned. In three years' time, with the Glorious Revolution and the ascension of the Protestant William of Orange, Defoe was, for a time, in the good graces of the crown. It did not prevent Defoe's arrest in 1692 for indebtedness, however\u2014for as much as \u00a317,000, by some accounts.  After his business failed, he traveled in Europe and tried his hand at other trades before becoming the operator of a tile and brick factory in Essex, a period of relative prosperity and peace for Defoe. He continued to be politically active, beginning to write in support of William III and the king's desire for a standing army. He published a poem in 1701, The True-Born Englishman, a satire defending the king against attacks on his foreign origin. William's death in 1702 heralded a calamitous period for Defoe, as the new Queen Anne was bent on curbing the rights of Nonconformists\u2014dissenters like Defoe who refused to recognize the authority of the Church of England. Defoe courted trouble that year by publishing an anonymous pamphlet titled The Shortest Way with Dissenters, a scathing satire that sarcastically endorsed the most brutal intolerance of dissenters. The piece was a little too on the nose in adopting the voice of the extreme conformists and ended up infuriating those on both sides of the issue. The authorities soon discovered Defoe as the true author of the document and sentenced him to stand for three days in the pillory at Temple Bar, followed by nearly two years' incarceration in Newgate Prison.  Defoe obtained his release by agreeing to act as a spy for the ruling Tory party. While being used to gather intelligence for one political faction, Defoe continued to write, founding A Review of the Affairs of France in 1704 | Question: Who was the author of 'The Shortest Way with Dissenters' and `A Journey of the Plague Year'?", "truth": ["daniel defoe"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4261", "mistake": "Daniel Defoe", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Character Bio  Mrs. Hudson is the landlady of 221B Baker Street. Sherlock won his way into her good graces after ensuring that her husband was executed for an unknown crime in Florida; given this, it may have been a domestic dispute (during a vacation to the America) that left Mrs. Hudson injured badly. Despite repeated declarations that she is not their housekeeper, she fusses over Sherlock and he takes it for granted that she will provide dinner for him.  She is often horrified to see Sherlock keep human body parts in his kitchen appliances (refrigerator, microwave) for experimentation. Though Sherlock has been shown to make Mycroft apologise to her for saying to shut up, he will do so himself when stressed. When she met John, Mrs. Hudson thought he was Sherlock's romantic partner, until being told she was wrong. Sherlock has a great deal of concern for her.

{"input": "Context: Pancho Villa - Military Leader - Biography.comPancho Villa - Military Leader - Biography.com  Military Leader  Pancho Villa was a top military leader of the Mexican Revolution whose exploits were regularly filmed by a Hollywood company.  IN THESE GROUPS  Pancho Villa - Death and Legacy (TV-14; 2:01) In 1920, Villa reached an agreement with Mexican leader Adolfo de la Huerta pardoning him for his actions. Three years later, on July 20, 1923, Pancho Villa was assassinated.  Synopsis  Born on June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango, Mexico, Pancho Villa started off as a bandit who was later inspired by reformer Francisco Madero, helping him to win the Mexican Revolution. After a coup by Victoriano Huerta, Villa formed his own army to oppose the dictator, with more battles to follow as Mexican leadership remained in a state of flux. He was assassinated on July 20, 1923, in Parral, Mexico.  Birth of a Bandit  Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa was born Doroteo Arango on June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango. Villa spent much of his youth helping out on his parents' farm. After his father's death when Villa was only 15 years old, he became head of the household. With his new role as protector of his houshold, he shot a man who was harassing one of his sisters in 1894. He fled, spending six years on the run in the mountains. While there, he joined a group of fugitives and became a bandit.  Although the specifics of what occurred in Villa's life during this time are unknown, it's confirmed that he changed his name while on the run to avoid getting caught by the authorities. In the late 1890s, he worked as a miner in Chihuahua in addition to selling stolen cattle. But it wasn't long before he added more serious crimes to his record, robbing banks and taking from the wealthy.  Mexican Revolutionary Leader  In 1910, while still living as a fugitive, Pancho Villa joined Francisco's Madero  successful uprising against Mexican dictator Porfirio D\u00edaz. With Villa's skills as at reading, writing, fighting and his knowledge of the land, Madero was named a revolutionary leader and his company won the first Battle of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in 1911. The rebels eventually drove D\u00edaz out of power, and Madero took the position of president, having named Villa a colonel.  It wasn't smooth sailing under the authority of the new government, as Madero's position was challenged by another rebellion, this time led by Pascual Orozco\u2014a revolutionary who worked with Madero and felt scorned by his position in under Madero's regime\u2014in 1912. General Victoriano Huerta and Villa sought to protect Madero's newfound authority, but after Huerta accused Villa of stealing his horse, Villa's execution was ordered. Although Madero was able to grant Villa a reprieve shortly before his execution, he was still required to serve time in prison in June 1912.  After escaping in December, it was revealed that Huerta was now against Madero's regime, and he assassinated Madero on February 22, 1913. As Huerta rose to power, Villa teamed up with a former ally, Emiliano Zapata, and Venustiano Carranza to overthrow the new president. As an experienced revolutionary leader, Villa controlled much of northern Mexico military forces during the revolt. Known as Division del Norte, or \"Division of the North,\" Villa led soldiers into battles by the droves, to the pleasure of onlookers the United States.  Lights, Camera, Revolution  The fact that the majority of Villa's battles were on the northern  border of Mexico brought the revolutionary to the spotlight in terms of  photographs and stories covering the events in Mexico. And surprisingly,  the bandit who once hid his presence and changed his name to avoid  attention loved being photographed. He even signed a contract with  Hollywood's Mutual Film Company in 1913 to have several of his battles  filmed.  Civil Unrest and Death  The U.S. supported Villa in more ways than simply behind a lens. After the numerous battles that occurred, Carranza rose to power in 1914.

As an agent of MI6, Bond holds code number \"007\". The 'double-O' prefix indicates his discretionary licence to kill in the performance of his duties.  Following the final departure of Sean Connery \u00a0in 1971, English actor Roger Moore took over the role from 1973 to 1985. To date he is the longest-serving James Bond actor, spanning twelve years in the role. He is also the oldest actor to play Bond; having begun the role at 45 and retiring from it at the age of 58. He appeared in Live and Let Die (1973), The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983) and A View to a Kill (1985).  Contents  Film biography  Shared background  Although very little of Bond's past is directly addressed during the Roger Moore era, it is assumed that his Bond continues to share the common background laid out by the Ian Fleming novels and preceding Bond films.  In the novels, James Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix , from the Canton de Vaud. He acquired a first-class command of the French and German languages during his early education, which he received entirely abroad. Both parents were tragically killed during a climbing accident in the French Alps when he was eleven.  After the death of his parents, Bond goes to live with his aunt, Miss Charmain Bond , where he completes his early education. Later, he briefly attends Eton College at \"12 or thereabouts\", but is removed after two halves because of girl trouble with a maid. After being sent down from Eton, Bond was sent to Fettes College in Scotland, his father's school. [1]  After leaving Fettes, earlier EON films note that Bond studied at Cambridge University. [2] [3] There, he achieved a first in Oriental languages. [4] In Fleming's novels, Bond alluded to briefly attending the University of Geneva (as did Fleming), before being taught to ski in Kitzb\u00fchel. [5] Following his graduation, Bond joined the Ministry of Defence and became a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves, rising though the ranks to commander. Bond applied to M for a position within the \" Secret Service \", part of the Civil Service, and rose to the rank of principal officer.  Live and Let Die (1973)  James Bond is sent to investigate the murder of three British MI6 agents, Dawes , Hamilton and Baines (who in fact shared the same bootmaker with Bond), all of whom have been killed within 24 hours. He discovers the victims were all separately investigating the operations of Dr. Kananga , the dictator of a small Caribbean island, San Monique. He also establishes that Kananga also acts as \"Mr. Big\", a ruthless and cunning gangster in the United States .

Perhaps the most eminent among the host of cabinet-makers active at this time was Thomas Chippendale, who published his book of influential designs, The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director, in 1754. This publication proved highly successful and influenced high-class tastes in furniture for many years. Several other trade directories followed, such as that featuring this four-poster bed design published in the late 1780s, though it was Chippendale\u2019s own designs that remained the most highly prized.  Chippendale set up his permanent premises in St Martin\u2019s Lane in 1755, from where he was able to service the aristocratic and wealthy residents of the expanding west end. Though remembered largely now for his furniture designs, Chippendale worked principally as an interior designer during his lifetime, advising the owners of country houses and town mansions on furniture, drapery and decoration.

The first edition of his celebrated pattern book, \"The Gentleman and Cabinet-maker's Director,\" was published in 1754 and the term \"Chippendale\" is regularly used to describe English Rococo furniture inspired by its illustrated designs. The book contains 161 engraved plates for a wide range of domestic furniture in the Gothic, Chinese, and Rococo styles as well as a series of plain domestic pieces. A virtually identical second edition was issued in 1755, and a third enlarged and revised edition appeared in 1762. The book sold well and helped the firm attract many fashionable clients, including the actor David Garrick. Chippendale's patterns were popular abroad, especially in North America, and the Museum has many pieces inspired by the designs from \"The Director\".

Andorra has all the other trappings of nationhood as well, such as a flag, diplomats and membership to important international bodies such as the EU and UN.

The showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, it was the first football match to be played at Wembley Stadium. King George V was in attendance to present the trophy to the winning team.  Each team had progressed through five rounds to reach the final. Bolton Wanderers won 1\u20130 in every round from the third onwards, and David Jack scored the lone goal each time. West Ham United faced opposition from the Second Division or lower in each round, the first time this had occurred since the introduction of multiple divisions in the Football League. West Ham took three attempts to defeat Southampton in the fourth round but then easily defeated Derby County in the semi-final, scoring five goals.  \u00a0  The final was preceded by chaotic scenes as vast crowds surged into the stadium, far exceeding its official capacity of approximately 125,000. A crowd estimated at up to 300,000 gained entrance and the terraces overflowed, with the result that spectators found their way into the area around the pitch and even onto the playing area itself. Mounted policemen, including one on a light-coloured horse which became the defining image of the day, had to be brought in to clear the crowds from the pitch to allow the match to take place. The match began 45 minutes late as crowds stood around the perimeter of the pitch. Although West Ham started strongly, Bolton proved the dominant team for most of the match and won 2\u20130. David Jack scored a goal two minutes after the start of the match and Jack Smith added a controversial second goal during the second half. The pre-match events prompted discussion in the House of Commons and led to the introduction of a number of safety measures for future finals.

(Recall the song title Every Little Bit Hurts .) Then I saw that the head noun bit wasn't there.  British students seem inclined to accept this phrase \u2014 possibly because they've been seeing it on bags and till slips for years (Tesco is still a mostly UK company).  But there seems to be an isogloss here (a boundary between dialects determined by the use of some particular word or phrase), with me and Denise on one side and possibly (we don't know yet) most British speakers on the other. What does seem clear is that this is not a productive or extensible pattern.  You just can't get away with other noun phrases formed, like every little, from a determinative and an adjective.  You really can't say *Every big is desirable, or *Each generous gets us closer to the goal.  The phrase every little, considered as a noun phrase, has to be some kind of special sui generis construction. It's not just a regular normal deployment of determinative and adjective.  I'm not saying you can never make a noun phrase with a determinative and an adjective; you certainly can make some, like the rich or the unthinkable.  (No, rich, or unthinkable are not nouns.  The argument is left as an exercise for the reader.)  There is even such a noun phrase using little as the adjective, namely a little.  But notice that *the little is not a well-formed noun phrase.  (A little goes a long way is a sentence of English, but *The little went a long way is not.)  The point is that there are only certain special noun phrase constructions of the form determinative + adjective.  *Every rich is not a noun phrase.  Nor is *all unthinkable.  And for at least me and Denise, *every little is no better than they are.  We are quick learners, and we will recognize the phrase from now on, so we can follow what Tesco is talking about.  We are not complaining. But the phrase seems to be a small extension of our language, rather than a pre-existing part of it.  [Update: Some of the comments below reveal that the origin of the phrase has nothing to do with Tesco, since every little has been established as a noun phrase for hundreds of years.  So the odd fact here is that in three decades of hearing British English before my departure for the USA, I never noticed it or used it, and arrived at my present maturity still finding it ungrammatical to my ear.  Let me add that there was some repetition and arguing and ill-tempered complaining in the comments below as of 4 a.m. Language Log time, and I have spend some of the late hours of the night shift deleting some of the clutter.  If your comment was a snippy complaint or repeated something or was clearly confused or was wildly irrelevant or was overtaken by events, don't be too surprised to find it gone.  One of the comments I did not delete despite my disagreement with it, from Mollymooly, says that the phrase is merely a proverb, and \"There are no generalisations to be drawn or lessons to be learnt. Everybody move along, now.\"  I couldn't fail not to disagree less.  This is not a proverb, and anyway proverbs can teach us things about syntax.  And from my quick look at this case, I have learned that the complexities of the syntax of the word little are much greater than I thought.  It is an adjective but also a determinative; it can participate in modifier-head fusion (see The Cambridge Grammar pp. 410ff on that), but only with various odd restrictions on what the determiner is | Question: \"Which company uses the advertising slogan \"\"Every Little Helps\"\"?\" ?", "truth": ["tesco"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6515", "mistake": "Tesco", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Context: Most Expensive Spices | eHowMost Expensive Spices | eHow  Most Expensive Spices  spices image by Bartlomiej Nowak from Fotolia.com  You might think of spices only as the tiny jars in the grocery aisle or on your spice rack. Spices have a long history in human culture, however, and for thousands of years, fortunes were made and lost in the spice trade. Valued for their flavor, color and medicinal properties, spices range from common and inexpensive to rare and extremely valuable. Experts at The Spice House note that the world's most expensive spices have inspired trade, exploration and even war.  Saffron  Saffron, produced from the stigma of the crocus flower, is easily the world's most expensive spice, costing $50 an ounce or more. Each crocus has three stigma, which are the tiny sticky bulbs in the center of the flower on which pollen lands. It takes about 75,000 blooms to make a pound of saffron; each flower must be hand-picked, and the stigma are stripped out by hand. One pound of saffron costs, on average, $1,000. In ancient times, saffron was used as medicine and for dye as well as in food. Spain is the world's top producer of saffron; other countries that produce the spice include Iran, Turkey, India and Morocco. Often used in Spanish and Asian rice and meat dishes, saffron has an intense flavor and adds a bright yellow color to a dish.  Cardamom  Cardamom spice is made from the seeds of the cardamom plant, a type of ginger native to India, Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. It has been used medicinally and as a flavoring for food for at least two millennia: the Indian medical text Charaka Samhita, written between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200, mentions cardamom. Like saffron, cardamom is expensive because it is labor-intensive to produce. The seed pods are hand-picked before they are fully ripe to ensure the freshness of the seeds. There are about 12 seeds per seed pod; 10 pods yield about 1 teaspoon of ground cardamom. India and Guatemala are the main producers of cardamom. It is a primary ingredient in curry, a popular additive to coffee in Arab countries and is widely used in Scandinavia to flavor baked goods. Whole cardamom pods sell for around $30 per pound; ground cardamom can be found for $6-$10 per ounce.  Vanilla  Pure vanilla rounds out the top three most expensive spices in the world. Artificial vanilla flavor is common, but true vanilla comes from the seed pod, or bean, of a type of orchid known as the vanilla plant. The plants are hand-pollinated and the pods take nine months to ripen, making vanilla expensive to produce. First cultivated by Totonaco Indians in Mexico over 500 years ago, today you can find vanilla in everything from ice cream to perfume. The Encyclopedia of Spices notes that Mexico and Madagascar produce the highest quality vanilla beans, and that prices range from $50 to $200 per pound. Pure vanilla extract sells for around $2 per ounce.  What Are The Two Most Expensive Spices\u2019 In - HomesteadExpensive spices, what are they?

Derived from the dried stigmas of the purple saffron crocus, it takes anything from 70,000 to 250,000 flowers to make one pound of saffron.

{"input": "Context: Kent Flag | British County FlagsKent Flag | British County Flags  British County Flags  Posted on August 3, 2013 by vexilo  The flag of Kent was included on the registry from its inception. The design of a white horse rearing on its hind legs has been associated with the county for over a thousand years. Tradition holds that the first Germanic invaders in Britain were Jutish mercenaries from the Danish peninsula, led by brothers Hengist and Horsa: the pair appear in the 9th century work on the history of the English people, \u201cHistoria Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\u201d by the Venerable Bede; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; the 9th century work attributed to the Welsh Monk Nennius, \u201cHistoria Brittonum\u201d and Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s 12th century \u201cHistoria Regum Brittaniae\u201d. All these works of course were completed centuries after the events they describe and the two brothers may well have been legendary, the theme of twin brothers appears frequently in Germanic stories as recorded by classical writers and additionally the horse was an important element in the rituals of many ancient peoples, with names derived from the words for horse appearing frequently \u2013 the Old English words \u201cHengest\u201d and \u201cHorsa\u201d meant respectively, \u201cstallion\u201d and \u201chorse\u201d. Conceivably, these founding fathers may in fact have been just the one individual, which is suggested by the similarity of these two names with equine associations. Reflecting all these characteristics, these Jutish invaders were said to have borne a banner bearing a white horse and it is further speculated that the symbol may have referred to the mythical horse Sleipner, which belonged to the god Odin, venerated by these Germanic warriors. The story of Hengist and Horsa further relates that the latter was killed in battle with the Celtic leader Vortigern at Aylesford, where a monument was raised in his honour, the White Horse Stone  near Maidstone. This standing stone is considered by some visitors to resemble a horse\u2019s head. Apparently the site has also been known locally as \u201cThe Ing\u00e1 stone\u201d, which presumably could be a corruption of the name \u201cHengist\u201d? An alternative school of thought postulates that the white horse of Kent is actually derived from the ancient white horses cut into chalk downs and stamped on the coins of more than one pre-Roman British king. However forged though, the link between the emblem of a white horse and the county of Kent was demonstrably established by the heraldic era.  As with Essex , the emblem of this early English kingdom was first recorded in print in the 1605 work \u201cRestitution of Decayed Antiquities\u201d by Richard Verstegen which included an engraving of Hengist and Horsa landing in Kent in 449 under the banner of a rampant white horse.  It is worth noting that the illustration specifically shows a flag bearing a horse rather than a shield, the inference is clear that the invading force specifically used a flag with the horse emblem on it and lends an obvious historical legitimacy to the horse bearing flag of Kent.  John Speed subsequently included the white horse in his 1611 \u201cAtlas of Great Britaine\u201d, appearing twice on a red shield, once held by \u201cHengist\u201d  and here on a blue shield  Although it has been suggested that the white horse was subsequently used by the Justices of Kent for many years no evidence of such usage has yet come to light. Evidently however, the white horse came to be generally regarded as the emblem of the former kingdom, turned county. Kent County Council, established in 1889, was formally awarded a grant of arms, bearing the white horse, on 17 October 1933  \u2013 the blazon of the shield, \u201cgules, a horse rampant argent\u201d i.e. red with a white rearing horse, is one of the simpler heraldic descriptions. As this emblem had already been in the public domain long before the creation of the council, an armorial banner formed from such anciently recognised arms could not be restricted to the council\u2019s use but represented the whole county as an entity in itself. The armorial banner was, therefore, the county flag and was thus accepted by the Flag Institute on the basis of this traditional association and use.

The urban zone of Genoa extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of 718,896. The urban area of Genoa has a population of 800,709. Over 1.5 million people live in the metropolitan area. Genoa is one of Europe's largest cities on the Mediterranean Sea and the largest seaport in Italy. Genoa has been nicknamed la Superba (\"the Proud one\") due to its glorious past and impressive landmarks. Part of the old town of Genoa was inscribed on the World Heritage List (UNESCO) in 2006 (see below). The city's rich art, music, gastronomy, architecture and history allowed it to become the 2004 European Capital of Culture. It is the birthplace of Christopher Columbus and Niccolo Paganini. Genoa, which forms the southern corner of the Milan-Turin-Genoa industrial triangle of north-west Italy, is one of the country\u2019s major economic centres. The city has hosted massive shipyards and steelworks since the 19th century, and its solid financial sector dates back to the Middle Ages. The Bank of Saint George, founded in 1407, is among the oldest in the world and has played an important role in the city\u2019s prosperity since the middle of the 15th century. Today a number of leading Italian companies are based in the city, including Selex ES , Ansaldo Energia , Ansaldo STS, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone and Piaggio Aero.   History   Prehistory and antiquity  The city cemetery, dating from the 6th and 5th centuries BC, testifies to the occupation of the site by the Greeks, but the fine harbor probably saw use much earlier, perhaps by the Etruscans. The ancient Ligurian city was known as Stalia (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u00ec\u03b1), so referred to by Artemidorus Ephesius and Pomponius Mela (this toponym is possibly preserved in the name of Staglieno, some 3 km (2 mi) from the coast). Ligurian Stalia was overshadowed by the powerful Marseille and Vada Sabatia, near modern Savona. Stalia had an alliance with Rome through a foedus aequum (\"equal pact\") in the course of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). The Carthaginians accordingly destroyed it in 209 BC. The town was rebuilt and, after the Carthaginian Wars ended in 146 BC. it received municipal rights. The original castrum thenceforth expanded towards the current areas of Santa Maria di Castello and the San Lorenzo promontory. Trades included skins, wood, and honey. Goods were shipped to the mainland, up to major cities like Tortona and Piacenza. The city's current name derives from the Latin word meaning \"knee\" (genu; plural, genua), from its geographical position at the centre of the Ligurian coastal arch, thus akin to the name of Geneva. The Latin name, oppidum Genua, is recorded by Pliny the Elder (Nat. Hist. 3.48) as part of the Augustean Regio IX Liguria. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Ostrogoths occupied Genoa. After the Gothic War, the Byzantines made it the seat of their vicar. When the Lombards invaded Italy in 568, the Bishop of Milan fled and held his seat in Genoa. Pope Gregory the Great was closely connected to these bishops in exile, for example involving himself the election of Deusdedit. The Lombards, under King Rothari, finally captured Genoa and other Ligurian cities in about 643. In 773 the Lombard Kingdom was annexed by the Frankish Empire; the first Carolingian count of Genoa was Ademarus, who was given the title praefectus civitatis Genuensis. Ademarus died in Corsica while fighting against the Saracens. In this period the Roman walls, destroyed by the Lombards, were rebuilt and extended. For the following several centuries, Genoa was little more than a small centre, slowly building | Question: In which city can you visit the Luigi Ferraris Stadium, the gardens of the Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini, the Piazza De Ferrari, the cemetery of Staglieno, the Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art and the Torre della Lanterna?", "truth": ["genova", "flag of genoa", "genoa"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3224", "mistake": "Genoa", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Context: George Melly | Music | The GuardianGeorge Melly | Music | The Guardian  George Melly  George Melly: singer, writer, fisherman, 'tart'.  Julian Mitchell  Share on Messenger  Close  George Melly, who has died aged 80, was one of the most genial and genuinely popular figures in the world of British entertainment. Dressed like a 30s gangster or a 40s Harlem hipster, a huge hat on his large head, his ample figure and rubbery face, with its mischievous hint of Mr Toad, were warmly welcomed wherever he went. He was a \"personality\" who actually had personality, a jazz singer who was also a cultural commentator, a devotee of the Surrealists who wrote the story-lines of a cartoon-strip. Presenter-performer, autobiographer, libertarian and in his own word \"tart\", he was \"Good-Time George\".  Alan George Heywood Melly was born in Liverpool. His father, an easy-going man, came from a large and well-known Liverpool business family, and made a comfortable living in the wool trade, which he hated. Tom didn't mind what anyone did, so long as it made them happy. Maud, George's Jewish mother, had once dreamed of a career on the stage, and remained a leading figure in Liverpool's amateur dramatics. (George's sister Andree was to become a well-known actress.) Maud was the friend of many theatrical queens, and visiting stars such as Robert Helpman, Frederick Ashton and Douglas Byng were often at the house near Aigburth Road, as was David Webster, then running a department store in Liverpool before taking over the Royal Opera House.  George wrote his autobiography backwards, starting with his early years in the jazz world, and working back to his childhood. Scouse Mouse (1984) is an affectionate account of 1930s middle-class Liverpool and its numerous Melly eccentrics. The snake in the Eden of Sefton Park was George's headmaster at Parkfield prep school, the alcoholic WW Twyne. A manic wielder of the house slipper, given to purple rages, Twyne deplored almost everything about the modern world except games. His denunciations of ballet and leftwing politics were so extreme that George knew at once that he would like both. Thus his interest in both anarchism and surrealism, developed at Stowe, can be traced to his comfortable Liverpudlian beginnings, just as his passion for fishing went back to family holidays in North Wales.  George clearly lacked officer-like qualities and was unable to qualify even as a naval clerk when he was called up in 1944. He remained a skiving Ordinary Seaman for most of his three and a half years service, leaving anarchist tracts on the messdeck to annoy his superior officers. He spent most of his leaves in London getting to know the Surrealist circle that gathered round the Belgian poet and gallery-owner ELT Mesens, and relishing an exuberant homosexual life made much easier by his uniform. Rum, Bum and Concertina (1977), his account of this period, is extremely funny. As a convinced surrealist George felt an obligation to be shocking and subversive, but his sense of reality and his sense of humour kept him out of serious trouble.  After the Navy he went to work for Mesens in his West End gallery, but was dismayed to find him a painfully bourgeois businessman, as he wrote in Don't Tell Sybil (1997), his memoir of their relationship.  Until then George had known jazz only from records, but he now started going to live performances of what was then called \"revivalist\" jazz. These were the years of early Humphrey Lyttelton, Graeme Bell and Cy Laurie. Quite soon George was singing with Mick Mulligan's band.  Owning Up (1965) is George's first-hand account of the professional jazz world of the 1950s, when the drinking was hard, the travel incessant and the sex easy. Under Mulligan's influence, George developed a voluminous appetite for girls, and eventually got married in 1955 to Victoria Vaughan.

A Straight Dope Classic from Cecil's Storehouse of Human Knowledge  Who invented the term \"rock 'n' roll\"?  February 28, 1986  Dear Cecil:  With all the recent furor over the location of the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, we all need to know: when, where, and by whom was the term \"rock 'n' roll music\" invented?  \u2014 DMc, Alexandria, Virginia  Cecil replies:  Depends what you mean by \"invent.\" The term was first used to describe a particular kind of music by Alan Freed, the legendary Cleveland disc jockey who was among the first to introduce black rhythm-and-blues music to a white audience. But the roots of the term go back much earlier.  In the 1920s the words \"rock\" and \"roll,\" used separately or together, were employed by black people to mean partying, carrying on, and/or having sex. According to rock historian Nick Tosches, blues singer Trixie Smith recorded a tune in 1922 called \"My Daddy Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)\" for Black Swan Records. \"Daddy,\" suffice it to say, wasn't trying to rock little Trixie to sleep. This song inspired such variations as \"Rock That Thing\" by Lil Johnson and \"Rock Me Mama\" by Ikey Robinson.  By the 1930s the term had begun to be associated with the idea of music with a good beat to it. In 1931 Duke Ellington did \"Rockin' in Rhythm\" for Victor. The Boswell Sisters did a song called \"Rock and Roll\" in the 1934 United Artists flick Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round. In 1939 Buddy Jones recorded \"Rockin' Rollin' Mama\" (String), in which he soulfully shouted, \"I love the way you rock and roll!\" But rockin' and rollin' didn't really catch on until 1948, when Wynonie Harris released \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" (King). An earlier version by Roy Brown (Deluxe, 1947) had bombed, but Wynonie's cover became a number one hit. That was the beginning of a flood of tunes that worked \"rock\" into the title, such as Bill Haley's \"Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie\" (1952), which contained the deathless words \"Rock, rock, rock, everybody/Roll, roll, roll, everybody.\"  In 1952 Alan Freed visited a Cleveland record store and learned that R&B records were being snapped up by white teenagers. Sensing the makings of something big, he changed the name of his popular music show on radio station WJW from \"Record Rendezvous\" to \"Moon Dog's Rock 'n' Roll House Party\" and began playing R&B tunes. Freed apparently used the term \"rock 'n' roll\" to describe the music because he thought the racial connotation of \"rhythm and blues\" might turn off the white audience. In any case, the term stuck.  Freed was the original high-energy, shout-along-with-the-record AM screamer, and his show, along with rock 'n' roll music, attracted a huge following. A rock 'n' roll show Freed promoted at Cleveland Stadium had to be canceled when the place was mobbed by thousands of fans. By 1954 Freed had moved to a late-night show on WINS in New York City, where he duplicated his earlier success.  On April 12, 1954, Bill Haley and the Comets recorded \"Rock Around the Clock,\" a teen anthem generally credited with making rock 'n' roll a worldwide phenomenon. Initially the tune did poorly, but when it was chosen as the theme for the film Blackboard Jungle, it became a monster smash in just about every country where the movie played, selling 22 million copies in all.

The Mortdecai actress opened up about the pair's relationship and how they've grown since announcing their \"conscious uncoupling\" in the January 2015 issue of Harper's Bazaar UK .  PHOTOS: Gwyneth and Chris through the years  \"It's painful, it's difficult, it might be easier to say, 'I never want to see you again,' but what good does that do anyone?\" Paltrow, 42, told the mag. \"We've made a lot of mistakes, and we've had good days and bad days, but I have to say, I'm proud of us for working through so much stuff together \u2013 and not blaming and shaming.\"  \"Of course, there are times when I think it would have been better if we had stayed married, which is always what your children want,\" she continued. \"But we have been able to solidify this friendship, so that we're really close.\"  PHOTOS: Gwyneth's most obnoxious quotes  Close in proximity, too. Paltrow and the Coldplay frontman, 37, have become L.A. neighbors since splitting in March, with Martin moving across the street. The exes have been photographed dining out together, and have stayed with tradition by celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with their daughter Apple, 10, and son Moses, 8.  \"There's a deep comfort about it because it's so familiar,\" Paltrow told Harper's Bazaar U.K. of her home. \"The other day I was lying on the grass and the kids were playing and I was looking at the blue sky and the palm-trees \u2013 and there was something about the weather and the smell and I was, like, eight years old again. I had such a strong memory of being a kid here \u2013 it's a really nice place to be a little kid, and it's great to watch my children have that experience.\"  Paltrow describes her separation with Martin as \"always a moving, amorphous thing,\" but a relationship that ultimately happened \"very fast.\" The two met soon after Paltrow's famous dad, producer-director Bruce Paltrow, died at 58 in October 2002. (Paltrow's mom is actress Blythe Danner.) Martin supported Paltrow through the difficult time, simultaneously sweeping her off her feet.

I felt like I was going to die of grief. I remember waking up, on one particular night, where I felt like I was having a heart attack and I couldn't breathe,\" Paltrow continued. \"I lay on the floor of my apartment in London and I thought, 'I'm not going to survive this.' And he just picked me up and he was so loving and patient through all my grieving. He's really great in a crisis.

The Mississippi State Penitentiary, also known as Parchman Farm or simply Parchman, became the main hub for Mississippi's penal system. Parchman Farm was in many ways reminiscent of a gigantic antebellum plantation and operated on the basis of a plan proposed by Governor John M. Stone in 1896. By 1917, Parchman was separated into twelve male camps and one female camp, and racial segregation was considered of paramount importance.  The convicts worked ten hours a day, six days a week, and slept in long, single-story buildings commonly called \"cages\" that were constructed of bricks and lumber produced on site. Most male prisoners were employed in farming, but some also worked in the brickyard, sawmill, cotton gin, and prison hospital. The female camp produced clothes and bed sheets for the entire farm. On Sundays, the convicts would attend religious services and often formed baseball games between opposing camps.  Because of the remote location and vast size of Parchman Farm, a sophisticated system of walls and fences was considered unnecessary. Prison officials would employ convicts they considered trustworthy as armed guards. These prisoners were known as \"trusty guards\" or \"trusty shooters\" and were separated from the general prison population.  These two photograph collections, designated PI/1996.0006 and PI/PEN/P37.4, showcase photographs taken at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in the early twentieth century.

Arthur Ashe began playing tennis as a boy in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia. After winning a tennis scholarship to UCLA, Ashe was taken under the wing of tennis star Pancho Gonzales, who recognized the young player\u2019s potential. In 1968, Ashe became the first black man to win the U.S. Open. Two years later, he captured the Australian Open for his second Grand Slam title. Over the next seven years, Ashe won his share of tournaments, but no more majors, and, frustrated, he set his sights on victory at Wimbledon, one of the most celebrated championships in tennis.  Arthur Ashe was 31 years old in 1975, and seemingly well past his prime, so his advancement to the 1975 Wimbledon finals came as somewhat of a surprise to the tennis establishment. While Ashe\u2019s best finishes at Wimbledon had been losses in the semi-finals in 1968 and 1969, his opponent, the brash 22-year-old Jimmy Connors, was the defending Wimbledon champion. In their three previous meetings, Connors had handled Ashe easily. Furthermore, Connors was coming off an impressive semi-final win against Roscoe Tanner, whose intimidating serve observers called the hardest hitting ever at Wimbledon.  Though many thought he didn\u2019t have a chance, Ashe formulated a game plan for the match: hit nothing hard. He planned to serve strongly and then give Connors nothing but \u201cjunk\u201d as Ashe himself described it. Connors won the first game of the first set, but then dropped the rest of the set in just 20 minutes, 6-1. Although Connors won just one game off Ashe in the second set, he took the third set 7-5. His confidence restored, Connors strutted around the court, while Ashe closed his eyes between sets, concentrating on the moment at hand. Finally, with the shocked crowd cheering him on, Ashe finished Connors off in the fourth set, 6-4.  Ashe retired from competitive tennis in 1980 after suffering a heart attack. For his career, he won 51 tournaments. In retirement, Ashe wrote the three-volume book A Hard Road to Glory, first published in 1988, which detailed the struggle of black athletes in America. In 1983, after double-bypass surgery, Ashe was infected with HIV during a blood transfusion. After revealing his disease to the world in 1992, he set about educating the public about HIV and AIDS. He died of AIDS-related complications on February 6, 1993. In 1997, the U.S. Open\u2019s new home court was named Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Baptized a Roman Catholic, Nkrumah spent nine years at the Roman Catholic elementary school in nearby Half Assini. After graduation from Achimota College in 1930, he started his career as a teacher at Roman Catholic junior schools in Elmina and Axim and at a seminary.  Increasingly drawn to politics, Nkrumah decided to pursue further studies in the United States . He entered Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1935 and, after graduating in 1939, obtained master\u2019s degrees from Lincoln and from the University of Pennsylvania . He studied the literature of socialism , notably Karl Marx and Vladimir I. Lenin, and of nationalism , especially Marcus Garvey , the black American leader of the 1920s. Eventually, Nkrumah came to describe himself as a \u201cnondenominational Christian and a Marxist socialist.\u201d He also immersed himself in political work, reorganizing and becoming president of the African Students\u2019 Organization of the United States and Canada. He left the United States in May 1945 and went to England, where he organized the 5th Pan-African Congress in Manchester.  Meanwhile, in the Gold Coast, J.B. Danquah had formed the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) to work for self-government by constitutional means. Invited to serve as the UGCC\u2019s general secretary, Nkrumah returned home in late 1947. As general secretary, he addressed meetings throughout the Gold Coast and began to create a mass base for the new movement. When extensive riots occurred in February 1948, the British briefly arrested Nkrumah and other leaders of the UGCC.  When a split developed between the middle-class leaders of the UGCC and the more radical supporters of Nkrumah, he formed in June 1949 the new Convention Peoples\u2019 Party (CPP), a mass-based party that was committed to a program of immediate self-government. In January 1950, Nkrumah initiated a campaign of \u201cpositive action,\u201d involving nonviolent protests, strikes, and noncooperation with the British colonial authorities.  From prison to prime ministry  In the ensuing crisis, services throughout the country were disrupted, and Nkrumah was again arrested and sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment. But the Gold Coast\u2019s first general election (Feb. 8, 1951) demonstrated the support the CPP had already won. Elected to Parliament, Nkrumah was released from prison to become leader of government business and, in 1952, prime minister of the Gold Coast.

Nkrumah\u2019s popularity in the country rose, however, as new roads, schools, and health facilities were built and as the policy of Africanization created better career opportunities for Ghanaians.  By a plebiscite of 1960 Ghana became a republic and Nkrumah became its president, with wide legislative and executive powers under a new constitution. Nkrumah then concentrated his attention on campaigning for the political unity of black Africa, and he began to lose touch with realities in Ghana.

As part of this, in 1861 a competition was held to choose a design for a new opera house, and the judges selected Charles Garnier\u2019s design, so the Paris Opera House is sometimes called the Garnier Opera. It took 15 years to complete the opera building, and Napoleon III had been replaced by the Third Republic by the time the Opera opened in 1875.  The Opera is huge, covering nearly 3 acres (12,000 square meters); it is the largest opera house in the world. It contains 2,000 seats for an audience and has room for 450 performers to participate on the stage. The Opera was built above an underground water source. During construction the lowest part of the foundation was flooded, and underground water fills the lowest basement like an underground lake.  Garnier\u2019s architectural style is considered the defining example of Second Empire style. Garnier blended classical Greek and Roman styles with a Baroque architectural spirit in his design of the Opera. Inside the building lies a colorful marble floor. Fine copper sculptures stand along walls, and massive crystal chandeliers sparkle as they hang from the ceilings. The ceilings themselves are decorated with sophisticated paintings. Seating above the main floor is arranaged in five tiers of boxes. The basic architectural design combined with the decorative details mixes impressive classic elegance with decorative extravagance, making the Opera similar to an European royal palace.  Today the Paris Opera (Palais Garnier) hosts ballet dance performances and classical music concerts, and occassionally an opera. More often, operas in Paris are performed at the Opera Bastille. Tickets can be purchased online .  The French author Gaston Leroux wrote a novel set in the Opera about the story of a genius writer with a facial deformity who lives secretly in the vast basement levels of the opera house. This story, the Phantom of the Opera, was published in serialization in 1909-1910; the story captured the imagination of readers and was adapted by filmmakers. In 1986, English composer Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s musical adaptation of the story began a long run in London. Webber\u2019s musical has been translated and performed all over the world, increasing the popularity of the opera and sparking widespread interest in Garnier\u2019s mysterious Opera House.

Chief executive officer Bob Symns and director of football Barry Fry attended the Football League annual general meeting in Portugal last week when the competition re-vamp was confirmed.  Bob Symns (right) with Posh chairman Darragh MacAnthony.  Premier League academy teams will be allowed to play in the EFL Trophy - previously known as the Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy - in a one-season trial in 2016-17.  The competition will be extended to 64 teams, with sides from 16 of the 21 category one academies invited to join League One and League Two clubs.  In a change from the current knock-out format, there will be 16 regional groups of four for the opening round, thus committing Posh to three matches in a competition that attracts pitiful crowds in the opening stages.  Symns defended the changes on the grounds of creating \u2018fresh interest in a competition everyone has been moaning about\u2019 and because the Premier League have added \u00a31 million to the prize pot.

He is best known for his career as a radio DJ and for the Kenny Everett television shows.  Contents  [ show ]  Radio career  Everett's first break (as Maurice Cole) came when he sent a tape to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1962. The BBC gave him an interview and offered him a job as a presenter on the Light Programme, the forerunner to BBC Radio 2. He declined, however, in favour of the less constrained world of pirate radio, where he began his career as a DJ for Radio London.  He teamed up with Dave Cash for the Kenny & Cash Show, one of the most popular pirate radio programmes. His offbeat style and likable personality quickly gained him attention, but in 1965 he was fired after some outspoken remarks about religion on air. Like most of the pirate stations, Radio London carried sponsored American evangelical shows and Everett's disparaging remarks about The World Tomorrow caused its producers to threaten to withdraw their lucrative contract with the station.  Everett returned six months later, however, before being given his own show by Radio Luxembourg in 1966. Within a year, he had joined the BBC's new pop music station Radio 1 after previewing The Beatles' new album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and interviewing the band. Everett had struck up a friendship with The Beatles and accompanied them on their 1966 tour of the United States, sending back daily reports for Radio London. He also produced their 1968 and 1969 Christmas records.  At Radio 1 Everett continued to develop his own unique presentation style, featuring zany voices, surreal characters, multi-tracked jingles and trailers, all of his own creation and compilation. It was ground-breaking radio material that has since been much copied.  Everett had a great love of sound recording equipment, in particular using reel-to-reel tape recorders, often adding sound-on-sound to his recordings and stereo/multi-track recordings of his pseudo-singing voice. These were broadcast on air regularly and he often created his own radio jingles. This skill was also transferred in some part to TV in his later career.  Everett is often cited as having coined the term 'Beeb' to refer to the BBC, although the corporation was occasionally referred to as the \"Beeb Beeb Ceeb\" in the seminal 1950s radio comedy series The Goon Show, and it is possible that Everett borrowed the expression from there (Everett cited Spike Milligan as a childhood hero and an artistic influence) . The term is still in popular use; the BBC have used 'the Beeb' themselves. The company previously used beeb.com), had a short lived 1980s children's magazine called Beeb, and named their digital channel for young children CBeebies.  Everett's shows on Radio 1 included Midday Spin and in 1968 he took over a Saturday show from 10 am to 12 noon.  In 1970, however, Everett again found himself fired, this time after suggesting on air that Mary Peyton, the British Transport Minister's wife, had bribed her driving test examiner. Following an interview on the BBC Radio Solent children's show Albert's Gang, Kenny submitted weekly shows to the station that he had pre-recorded at home. This afforded the BBC the opportunity to vet the shows before broadcast. Everett was then heard on various BBC local radio stations before being reinstated at Radio 1 in 1972. Here he recorded a weekly show from his home in Wales and it went out on a Sunday afternoon.  During this time, legislation had been passed allowing the licensing of commercial radio stations in the UK. One of the first, Capital Radio, began broadcasting to London and the Home Counties in 1973.

{"input": "Context: BBC - History - James CallaghanBBC - History - James Callaghan  z  James Callaghan   \u00a0 \u00a9 Callaghan was British Labour prime minister from 1976 to 1979, years dominated by economic recession and industrial militancy which contributed to the election of the Conservatives and Labour's exclusion from office for the next 18 years.  Callaghan was born on 27 March 1912 in Portsmouth and began working life for the Inland Revenue at the age of 16. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and in 1945 was elected Labour member of parliament for Cardiff South. In 1964, he was chosen by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson to be chancellor of the exchequer. His effectiveness at the Treasury, however, was limited by his resolute refusal to devalue the pound, which left British exports highly uncompetitive, and also by a power struggle with George Brown's Department of Economic Affairs, a new ministry deliberately created by Wilson to limit the power of the treasury. When devaluation became unavoidable in 1967, Callaghan was moved to the home office. Here he adopted an authoritarian and conservative line. He also took the decision to deploy British troops to Northern Ireland in 1969 after sectarian violence in the province.  Callaghan also made a decisive intervention against Barbara Castle's plans for a wages policy in 1969, a move that reinforced his credentials as a staunch ally of the trade unions, but also contributed to the unravelling of Labour's economic strategy in the 1970s. After serving as foreign secretary in 1974-1976, Callaghan succeeded Wilson as prime minister in 1976. He responded to Britain's deepening economic recession by adopting deflationary policies and cuts in public expenditure, which anticipated the monetarism of Margaret Thatcher after 1979.  He succeeded in securing some improvement in the nation's situation, but then committed a tactical error in postponing a general election until the spring of 1979, only to see his government totally discredited by mass industrial militancy during the 1978-1979 'winter of discontent'. He resigned as leader soon after the 1979 election, and later became a life peer. He died on 26 March 2005.

He was the father of Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington, Labour peer and former Leader of the House of Lords.  James Callaghan is the only 20th-century British Prime Minister to have held all 4 major offices of state: Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister.

The Cup\u2019s origins date back to Christmas Day 1872, and a match in Calcutta, India. A team of English players took on a side made up of Scottish, Welsh and Irish players in the sweltering Indian heat.  The match led to the formation of the Calcutta Football Club in 1873, but by 1877 the club had wilted in the heat of the subcontinent and disbanded.  The club\u2019s funds were withdrawn from the bank as silver rupees, which were then melted down and made into a cup.  The Rugby Football Union in England were given the Cup, and decided to award it to the winners of an annual game between Scotland and England.  The first clash for the Calcutta Cup ended in a draw, at Edinburgh\u2019s Raeburn Place in March of 1879. The fixture has taken place every year since, with the only breaks coming for the two World Wars, and competition for the Cup remains as fierce as ever.

Jeffrey admitted to his role in the hijinks - largely to quash rumours he had kicked the Cup down Princes Street.

{"input": "Context: birth control: History of the Birth Control Movementbirth control: History of the Birth Control Movement  birth control  History of the Birth Control Movement  Although contraceptive techniques had been known in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, the modern movement for birth control began in Great Britain, where the writings of Thomas Robert Malthus stirred interest in the problem of overpopulation. By the 1870s a wide variety of birth control devices were available in English and American pharmacies, including rubber condoms and diaphragms, chemical suppositories, vaginal sponges, and medicated tampons. Easy public access to contraceptive devices in the United States aroused the ire of Anthony Comstock and others, who lobbied Congress until it passed (1873) a bill prohibiting the distribution of these devices across state lines or through the mail. Moreover, in England in 1877, Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh were tried for selling The Fruits of Philosophy, a pamphlet on contraceptive methods, written in 1832 by an American, Charles Knowlton. After their famous trial, the Malthusian League was founded. Meanwhile, a variety of contraceptive devices remained available to a large public, usually advertised in veiled but unmistakable language.  In 1878 the first birth control clinic was founded in Amsterdam by Aletta Jacobs. The first U.S. birth control clinic, opened (1916) by Margaret Sanger in Brooklyn, N.Y., was closed by the police; she received a 30-day jail sentence. She later permanently established a clinic in New York City in 1923. In Great Britain the Malthusian League, aided by Marie Stopes , established a birth control clinic in London in 1921.  Sanger also helped organize (1917) the National Birth Control League in the United States; in 1921 it became the American Birth Control League, and in 1942 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Meanwhile, in 1918 an American judge ruled that contraceptive devices were legal as instruments for the prevention of disease, and the federal law prohibiting dissemination of contraceptive information through the mails was modified in 1936. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, birth control advocates were engaged in numerous legal suits. In 1965 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the one remaining state law (in Connecticut) prohibiting the use of contraceptives.  The federal government began to take a more active part in the birth control movement in 1967, when 6% of the funds allotted to the Child Health Act was set aside for family planning; in 1970, the Family Planning Services and Population Act established separate funds for birth control. Birth control and sex education in schools continue to be emotional issues in the United States, where adolescent sexual activity and pregnancy rates are high and bring with them increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases and complications of pregnancy, as well as societal and personal costs.  Birth control on the international level is led by the International Planned Parenthood Federation, founded in 1952, with members in 134 countries by 1995. Sweden was one of the first countries to provide government assistance for birth control, which it did as early as the 1930s. Two of the more successful birth control programs have been in Japan, where the birthrate has been dramatically reduced, and\u2014more controversially\u2014in China, where the government has a \"one family, one child\" policy and local authorities have typically intimated women pregnant into aborting a second pregnancy. Several of the so-called underpopulated nations, however, have a stated policy of encouraging an increased birthrate, e.g., Argentina, and concern over declining populations has increased in recent years in certain Western European countries and Russia. Among religious bodies, the Roman Catholic Church has provided the main opposition to the birth control movement; popes Paul VI and John Paul II reaffirmed this stance in encyclicals.

Whittington, who was the son of a knight of Gloucestershire , opened a mercer\u2019s shop in London that supplied velvets and damasks to such notables as Henry Bolingbroke (later King Henry IV). He then entered city politics and served three terms as lord mayor of London: 1397\u201399, 1406\u201307, and 1419\u201320. By 1400 Whittington had acquired immense wealth and commercial prestige .

He ventures his only possession, a cat, as an item to be sold on one of his master\u2019s trading ships. Ill-treated by the cook, Dick then runs away, but just outside the city he hears the prophetic peal of bells that seems to say \u201cTurn again, Whittington, lord mayor of great London\u201d (or \u201cThrice lord mayor of London\u201d).

It tells of a poor boy in the 14th century who becomes a wealthy merchant and eventually the Lord Mayor of London because of the ratting abilities of his cat. The character of the boy is named after a real-life person, Richard Whittington, but the real Whittington did not come from a poor family and there is no evidence that he had a cat.  The first recorded pantomime version of the story was in 1814, starring Joseph Grimaldi as Dame Cecily Suet, the Cook. The pantomime adds another element to the story, rats, and an arch villain, the Pantomime King (or sometimes Queen) Rat, as well as the usual pantomime fairy, the Fairy of the Bells. Other added characters are a captain and his mate and some incompetent pirates. In this version, Dick and his cat \"Tommy\" travel to Morocco, where the cat rids the country of rats. The Sultan rewards Dick with half of his wealth. Sybil Arundale played Dick in many productions in the early years of the 20th century  The real Richard Whittington ( Dick Whittington ) lived from about 1350-1423. He achieved many things in his life. Now he is known for having a pet cat and 'turning again'.  Richard or 'Dick' Whittington was born during the 1350s. He was the younger son of Sir William Whittington, Lord of the Manor of Pauntley in Gloucestershire. Sir William died in 1358. The oldest son inherited the estate, so Richard travelled to London to find work.  Whittington served an apprenticeship, and eventually became a \u2018mercer', dealing in valuable cloth from abroad, such as silks, velvets and cloth of gold.

The 36-year-old former PE teacher crossed the finish line of the round-the-world Vend\u00e9e Globe yacht race in sixth place onboard her yacht Aviva with a heavily damaged mainsail having spent 99 days at sea.  The British skipper, supported by insurance group Aviva entered the record books in May 2006 by becoming the first woman to sail solo, non-stop the \u2018wrong' way around the world (against the prevailing winds and currents). That solo circumnavigation took her 178 days in a 72 foot steel yacht. Now three years later Caffari, who only started solo sailing in 2005, has taken less than 100 days to complete her solo circumnavigation the \u2018right' way around the world.  Caffari was surrounded by a flotilla of supporter boats as she crossed the line, holding bright white flares above her head.  Caffari said: \"This is just incredible! To see all these people here to watch me cross the line and make history is just awesome. The support and recognition has been unbelievable. I'm quite exhausted but I'll be buzzing for the next few days. My goal was to set the double world first and Aviva and I have done it. It's an amazing feeling to become the first woman to sail solo, non-stop both ways around the world. You just can't buy an experience like this, it's awesome!\"  However, the race was not without incident as Caffari was forced to use all her tenacity and determination to battle her way to the finish line with her severely damaged mainsail looking like a shredded \u2018string vest'. The mainsail is a solo skipper's key sail that provides the majority of the power to the 60 foot carbon fibre racing machine but since the Southern Ocean Caffari has had continuous problems caused by the sail falling apart.  In an effort to keep the sail in one piece Caffari even resorted to using the skin staples from her medial kit and had to cut up one of her additional sails (the code 5) to patch the most badly affected areas. However, three months of ocean racing with hurricane force winds and enormous waves have left the sail in tatters. Nonetheless, the British skipper kept her eyes on the ultimate prize, to set a double world first and make history.  She added: \"The mainsail constantly caused me concern. You just have to look at it to see what a dreadful state it's in but I managed to struggle on. I never let it get the better of me. I had an opportunity here to make history so a disintegrating mainsail wasn't going to get in my way. It's been frustrating and tiring but Aviva and I are here now and I'm on cloud nine!\"  The Vend\u00e9e Globe has been littered with drama and excitement, with nineteen yachts retired from thirty starters making the race a war of attrition. It has been a battle that Caffari has bravely fought to reach her ultimate goal.  The solo skipper added: \"The Vend\u00e9e Globe has a reputation as the \u2018Everest of the Seas' and this edition has certainly lived up to its name. There was disaster and drama at every turn with dismastings, Yann Elies's broken leg and Jean Le Cam's capsize. It was hard not to get distracted but I just had to keep going. My focus was getting Aviva and I home safe and sound and with the support of my team I've managed that so I'm over the moon.\"  Britain's Dee Caffari has become the first woman to have ...Britain's Dee Caffari has become the first woman to have sailed solo and non-stop both ways around the world | Travel | The Guardian | Question: In 2009, who became the first woman to have sailed solo and non-stop, both ways around the world in her boat 'Aviva'?", "truth": ["dee caffari"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4362", "mistake": "Dee Caffari", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}

Sponsored Links  Born on 7 August 1876 in        Leeuwarden in the Netherlands, Mata Hari's name has since become synonymous        with espionage, although it remains by no means clear that she was guilty of        the spying charges for which she charged.  The daughter of a        well-to-do hatter, Mata Hari attended a teachers' college in Leiden before,        in 1895, marrying Captain Campbell MacLeod (of Scottish antecedents but        serving in the Dutch army).\u00a0 They lived together from 1897-1902 in Java        and Sumatra.  Returning to Europe        together they thereafter separated, at which point Mata Hari took to dancing        upon the Paris stage from 1905, initially as 'Lady MacLeod' and soon after        as 'Mata Hari', the name she retained until her execution.  Highly successful in Paris        (among other cities), Mata Hari's attractiveness, as well as her apparent        willingness to appear almost nude on the stage, made her a huge hit.\u00a0 She cultivated numerous lovers, including many military officers.  Still unclear today are the        circumstances around her alleged spying activities.\u00a0 It was said that        while in The Hague in 1916 she was offered cash by a German consul for        information obtained on her next visit to France.\u00a0 Indeed, Mata Hari        admitted she had passed old, outdated information to a German intelligence        officer when later interrogated by the French intelligence service.  Mata Hari herself claimed        she had been paid to act as a French spy in Belgium (then occupied by German        forces), although she had neglected to inform her French spymasters of her        prior arrangement with the German consul.\u00a0 She was, it seemed, a double        agent, if a not very successful one.  It appears (the details are        vague) that British intelligence picked up details of Mata Hari's        arrangements with the German consul and passed these to their French        counterparts.  She was consequently        arrested by the French on 13 February 1917 in Paris.\u00a0 Following        imprisonment she was tried by a military court on 24-25 July 1917 and        sentenced to death by a firing squad.\u00a0 The sentence was carried out on        15 October 1917 in Vincennes near Paris.\u00a0 She was 41.  To many she remains the        unfortunate victim of a hysterical section of the French press and public        determined to root out evidence of a non-existent enemy within, a scapegoat        attractive as much for her curious profession as for her crimes.

From the time he was a child, he was a great athlete and played baseball, football, basketball, tennis and ran track. Jackie, however, loved baseball.  Jackie grew up in a time where discrimination was accepted. African-American people like Jackie did not have the same rights at White people. They were not accepted in Major League Baseball, so Jackie\u2019s baseball career started with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues \u2013 a baseball league for African-American players.  In 1946, however, Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey decided to sign Jackie Robinson to a Major League contract. Jackie would become the first African-American athlete in 57 years to play in Major League Baseball, thus breaking the \u201ccolor barrier.\u201d Many fans and fellow baseball players refused to accept Jackie as an equal. He continued to experience discrimination and racism. Nevertheless, Jackie excelled on the field, and quickly became one of Major League Baseball\u2019s best players. In 1949, he was named Major League Baseball\u2019s most valuable player (MVP). In 1955, he led the Brooklyn Dodgers to their only World Series Championship.  In 1956, Jackie Robinson retired from Major League Baseball. He was voted a member of the Major League Baseball Hall-of-Fame in 1962 and died in 1972. Today, Major League Baseball has permanently retired Jackie\u2019s number 42 to honor his memory and courage. This means no player on any team will ever be able to wear 42 again.  Jackie Robinson - Fact-index.comJackie Robinson  Main Page | See live article | Alphabetical index  Jackie Robinson  Jack Roosevelt Robinson ( January 31 , 1919 - October 24 , 1972 ) became the first black Major League baseball player of the modern era in 1947 . The significance of this event in U.S history is such that every major league baseball team has retired his number, 42.  Born in Cairo, Georgia , USA, Jackie Robinson was a football and baseball star at the University of California in Los Angeles, where he played with Kenny Washington, who would become one of the first black players in the National Football League . After serving in the military during World War II, Robinson played baseball for a while for the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro Leagues . There, he was noticed by a scout working for Branch Rickey .  Rickey was the club president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers , and had the secret goal of signing the Negro Leagues' top players to the team. Although there was no official ban on blacks in organized baseball, previous attempts at signing black ballplayers had been thwarted by league officials and rival clubs in the past, and so Rickey operated under cover. His scouts were, supposedly, scouting for a new all-black league Rickey was forming.  Even the scouts themselves did not know the true objective.  Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising candidates, signed him, and assigned him to play for the Dodgers' minor-league affiliate in Montreal in 1946 . Although that season was very trying emotionally for Robinson, it was also a spectacular success in a city that treated him with all the wild fan support that made the Canadian city a welcome refuge from the hateful harassment he experienced elsewhere.  Robinson was a slightly curious candidate to be the first black Major Leaguer in sixty years.  Not only was he 27, old for a prospect, he also had a fiery temperament. His future Dodger teammate Roy Campanella might have been a better candidate to face the jeering crowds and abusive opponents that Rickey had expected.  Robinson's debut at second base with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15 , 1947 , was one of the most eagerly-awaited events in baseball history, and one of the most profound in the history of the U.S. civil rights movement.

The original three originated in Boetia. Later four Muses, according to Pausanias (late 2nd century AD),\u00a0were regarded as the daughters of Zeus and Plusia. Their names were: Thelexinoe; Aode meaning \u2018song\u2019 or \u2018voice\u2019; Arche; and Melete meaning \u2018practice\u2019 or \u2018occasion\u2019. Also included was Mneme meaning \u2018memory\u2019. The Muses at Delphi were worshipped as Nete, Mese, and Hypate. Credited as the daughters of Apollo they were called Cephisto. Apollonis, and Borythemis. The\u00a0meaning of the name Mnemosyne in English is \u2018mind\u2019 memory\u2019 or mental\u2019, and similarly in Sanskrit it is \u2018mantra\u2019.  The muses presided over poetry, science, dance, art and music and therefore guided and inspired human intellectual and creative expression. As such they were seen as the personification and source of all knowledge, as well as embodying mousike or performed metrical speech.  The Muses were born at Pieria near Olympus, this was their favourite dwelling place, and is the reason they are sometimes called the Pierids. Originally regarded as water nymphs the Muses are thus associated with sacred springs and sites.  Apollo and the Muses on Mount Helicon (1680).\u00a0 Claude Lorrain.  There are sites sacred to the Muses on Mount Parnassus, at Castalia, and Mount Helicon in Boetia, as well as the springs and fountains of Aganippe, Hippocrene, and Pirene. The muses, an original triad, were in fact mountain-goddesses representing the Triple Goddess in her ritualistic or Dionysiac guise. The\u00a0in their form as the Triple Muse of Mount Parnassus\u00a0they were also called the Thriae.  2.\u00a0 The Nine Muses of Antiquity  The sisterhood of the nine Muses are also known as the Aganippides; the Castalides; the Corycian Nymphs, the Corycides, the Musae Pierides; the Tuneful Nine; the Camanae; and the Virgins of Helicon. The Aganippids were named because of their association with the fountain of Aganippe. The Corycian nymphs lived in a cave, the Corycian Cave, on Mount Parnassus. \u00a0The original three were Aode, Melete, and Mneme though another trio were named Hypate, Mese, and Nete. A later four were called Arche, Aoide, Malete, and Theixinoe. Hesiod preferred to refer to the Muses as the daughters of Air and Mother Earth.  Furthermore, Pierus was also credited of being the father, through the Pimpleian nymph called Antiope, of seven muses named Neilo, Tritone, Asapo, Heptapora, Achelois, Tipoplo, and Rhodia. Other Greek scholars names nine muses as Kallichore, Helike, Eunike, Thelxinoe, Terpsichore, Euterpe, Wukelade, Dia, and Enope. Many of the attributes and descriptions of the nine muses were assigned much later during Roman times.

{"input": "Context: Pol Pot, Butcher of Cambodia - BiographyPol Pot, Butcher of Cambodia - Biography  Pol Pot, Butcher of Cambodia  Cambodia  Pol Pot, Butcher of Cambodia  Pol Pot, former Khmer Rouge leader of Cambodia responsible for the Killing Fields, shortly before his death in 1998.\u00a0 Getty Images  Updated August 09, 2016.  Pol Pot. The name is synonymous with horror.  Even in the blood-drenched annals of twentieth-century history , Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia stands out for the sheer scale and senselessness of its atrocities. In the name of creating an agrarian communist revolution, Pol Pot and his underlings killed at least 1.5 million of their own people in the infamous Killing Fields. They wiped out between 1/4 and 1/5 of the country's entire population.  Who would do this to their own nation? What kind of monster kills millions in the name of erasing a century of \"modernization\"? Who was Pol Pot?  Early Life:  A child named Saloth Sar was born in March of 1925, in the little fishing village of Prek Sbav, French Indochina . His family was ethnically mixed, Chinese and Khmer, and comfortably middle-class. They owned fifty acres of rice-paddies, which was ten times as much as most of their neighbors, and a large house that stood on stilts in case the river flooded.  continue reading below our video  Profile of Pol Pot  Saloth Sar was the eighth of their nine children.  Saloth Sar's family had connections with the Cambodian royal family. His aunt had a post in the future King Norodom's household, and his first cousin Meak as well as his sister Roeung served as royal concubines. Saloth Sar's elder brother Suong was also an officer at the palace.  When Saloth Sar was ten years old, his family sent him 100 mile south to the capital city of Phnom Penh to attend the Ecole Miche, a French Catholic school. He was not a good student. Later, the boy transferred to a technical school in Kompong Cham, where he studied carpentry. His academic struggles during his youth would actually stand him in good stead in decades to come, given the Khmer Rouge's anti-intellectual policies.  French Technical College:  Probably because of his connections rather than his scholastic record, the government gave him a scholarship to travel to Paris , and pursue higher education in the field of electronics and radio technology at the Ecole Francaise d'Electronique et d'Informatique (EFRIE). Saloth Sar was in France from 1949 to 1953; he spent most of his time learning about Communism rather than electronics.  Inspired by Ho Chi Minh's declaration of Vietnamese independence from France, Saloth joined the Marxist Circle, which dominated the Khmer Students' Association in Paris. He also joined the French Communist Party (PCF), which lionized the uneducated rural peasantry as the true proletariat, in opposition to Karl Marx's designation of the urban factory-workers as the proletariat.  Return to Cambodia:  Saloth Sar flunked out of college in 1953. Upon his return to Cambodia , he scouted out the various anti-government rebel groups for the PCF, and reported that the Khmer Viet Minh was the most effective.  Cambodia became independent in 1954 along with Vietnam and Laos , as part of the Geneva Agreement which France used to extract itself from the Vietnam War . Prince Sihanouk played the different political parties in Cambodia off against one another and fixed elections; nonetheless, the leftist opposition was too weak to seriously challenge him either at the ballot box or through guerrilla war. Saloth Sar became a go-between for the officially recognized left-wing parties and the communist underground.  On July 14, 1956, Saloth Sar married teacher Khieu Ponnary. Somewhat incredibly, he got work as a lecturer in French history and literature at a college called Chamraon Vichea. By all reports, his students loved the soft-spoken and friendly teacher. He would soon move up within the communist sphere, as well.

The creation of the new country was among the complex causes for the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Nigerian-Biafran War.  Land of the Rising Sun was chosen for Biafra's national anthem, and the state was formally recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania and Zambia. Other nations which did not give official recognition but which did provide support and assistance to Biafra included Israel, France, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa and the Vatican City. Biafra also received aid from non-state actors, including Joint Church Aid, Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland, Caritas International, MarkPress and U.S. Catholic Relief Services.  After three years of war and the loss of more than two million lives, the nascent republic lost its struggle for independence and was reabsorbed into Nigeria in January 1970. The leader of the republic, Oxford-trained General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, went into exile, but later returned to Nigeria in 1983 under special pardon. In 1969 Biafra adopted one of the most progressive national constitutions in Africa at the time. The Constitution or \"Principles\" drew heavily from traditional communal modes of governance but was also informed by progressive political developments in other parts of the world in the 1960s, and the ideology of \"Non-alignment\" adopted by several postcolonial states during the Cold War. It also provided a platform for the country to criticise the West for its role in the plight of the rest of the world and to set out the ideals of the young nation.

{"input": "Context: Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of EssexRobert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, KG PC (; 10 November 1565  \u2013 25 February 1601) was an English nobleman and a favourite of Elizabeth I. Politically ambitious, and a committed general, he was placed under house arrest following a poor campaign in Ireland during the Nine Years' War in 1599. In 1601, he led an abortive coup d'\u00e9tat against the government and was executed for treason. He is an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II.   Early life  Essex was born on 10 November 1565 at Netherwood near Bromyard, in Herefordshire, the son of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and Lettice Knollys. His maternal great-grandmother Mary Boleyn was a sister of Anne Boleyn, the mother of Queen Elizabeth I, making him a first-cousin-twice-removed of the Queen.  He was brought up on his father's estates at Chartley Castle, Staffordshire, and at Lamphey, Pembrokeshire, in Wales. His father died in 1576, and the new Earl of Essex became a ward of Lord Burghley. In 1577, he was admitted as a fellow-commoner at Trinity College, Cambridge; in 1579, he matriculated; and in 1581 he graduated as Master of Arts.   On 21 September 1578, Essex's mother married Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth I's long-standing favourite and Robert Devereux's godfather.   Essex performed military service under his stepfather in the Netherlands, before making an impact at court and winning the Queen's favour. In 1590, he married Frances Walsingham, daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham and widow of Sir Philip Sidney, by whom he was to have several children, three of whom survived into adulthood. Sidney, Leicester's nephew, died in 1586 at the Battle of Zutphen in which Essex also distinguished himself. In October 1591, Devereux's mistress, Elizabeth Southwell, gave birth to a son who survived into adulthood.    Court and military career  Essex first came to court in 1584, and by 1587 had become a favourite of the Queen, who relished his lively mind and eloquence, as well as his skills as a showman and in courtly love. In June 1587 he replaced the Earl of Leicester as Master of the Horse.  After Leicester's death in 1588, the Queen transferred the late Earl's royal monopoly on sweet wines to Essex, providing him with revenue from taxes. In 1593, he was made a member of her Privy Council.  Essex underestimated the Queen, however, and his later behaviour towards her lacked due respect and showed disdain for the influence of her principal secretary, Robert Cecil. On one occasion during a heated Privy Council debate on the problems in Ireland, the Queen reportedly cuffed an insolent Essex round the ear, prompting him to half draw his sword on her.   In 1589, he took part in Francis Drake's English Armada, which sailed to Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to press home the English advantage following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, although the Queen had ordered him not to take part in the expedition. In 1591, he was given command of a force sent to the assistance of King Henry IV of France. In 1596, he distinguished himself by the capture of Cadiz. During the Islands Voyage expedition to the Azores in 1597, with Walter Raleigh as his second in command, he defied the Queen's orders, pursuing the treasure fleet without first defeating the Spanish battle fleet.  When the Spanish fleet appeared off the English coast during the 3rd Spanish Armada in the Autumn of 1597 panic then ensued because the English fleet had been far out to sea with the coast virtually undefended. This further depleted the relationship between the Queen and Essex even though initially he was put in charge of the fleet to face the Spanish threat.  Ireland  Essex's greatest failure was as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, a post which he talked himself into in 1599.

They were armed with a mortuary sword and two flintlock pistols [55187] ]]  Ironside was the name given to a trooper in the Parliamentarian cavalry formed by English  political leader Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, during the English Civil War . The name came from \"Old Ironsides\", one of Cromwell's nicknames. A contemporary Parliamentarian newspaper asserted that it was the Royalist Prince Rupert who had given Cromwell the nickname after Rupert's defeat at Marston Moor in July 1644: Munday we had intelligence that Lieutenant-Gen. Cromwell alias Ironside (for that title was given him by P. Rupert after his defeate neere York) was about Redding with 2500 horse...  The model regiment  in Huntingdonshire  , on 29 August, 1642, early in the Civil War. John Desborough was quartermaster. The troop was late in being organised, and arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Edgehill  , the first pitched battle of the war. Cromwell however did witness the defeat of the Parliamentarian horse at the battle and wrote to fellow Parliamentarian leader John Hampden ,  Your troopers are most of them old decayed servingmen and tapsters; and their [the Royalists' ] troopers are gentlemens' sons, younger sons and persons of quality; do you think that the spirits of such base and mean fellows [as ours] will ever be able to encounter gentlemen that have honour and courage and resolution in them?  Within the Eastern Association  It is evident that Cromwell's answer to his own question lay in religious conviction. Early in 1643, he was given a commission as Colonel and expanded his troop into a full regiment in the newly formed Army of the Eastern Association , under the command of Lord Grey of Warke and then the Earl of Manchester . By 11 September that year, he referred to them in a letter to his cousin Oliver St. John as a \"lovely company\". A champion of the \"godly\", Cromwell became notorious for appointing men of comparatively humble origins but stoutly-held Puritan beliefs as officers, who would then attract men of similar background and leanings to the regiment. He wrote to his commander, the Earl of Manchester , who disagreed with this policy,  I had rather have a plain russet-coated captain that knows what he fights for and loves what he knows, than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else.  I honour a gentleman that is so indeed.  On 28 July 1643, the regiment took part in the Battle of Gainsborough  , where Royalist cavalry were defeated. One of the troop captains, James Berry, is stated to have killed the Royalist commander, Sir Charles Cavendish , a relation of Sir William, the Marquess of Newcastle (Commander-in-Chief of the Royalist forces in the North).  The regiment's troops in 1643 were:  Captain Ralph Margery's  Captain Henry Ireton 's (Transferred from the Earl Of Essex's regiment  By April, 1644, after two years of war, Cromwell's unit had grown into a \"double\" regiment of no less than 14 troops. (A regiment normally had only 6 troops). Cromwell by this time was Lieutenant General of the Horse in the Parliamentarian Army of the Eastern Association, and the regiment would be routinely commanded by its Lieutenant Colonel , Cromwell's cousin Edward Whalley. The regiment played a major part in the victory over the Royalists at the Battle of Marston Moor  , where the discipline of Cromwell's wing of horse was decisive. Where a victorious wing of Royalist cavalry scattered in search of plunder, Cromwell's men rallied after defeating their immediate opponents, and then swept the disordered Royalist armies from the field. Captain Valentine Walton, Cromwell's nephew, died of wounds after a cannon shot smashed his leg during the battle.

The billionaire American, whose existing golf course project in Scotland has been overshadowed by a series of controversies, has bought Turnberry from the Dubai-based Leisurecorp.  The sum is undisclosed but Trump is believed to have paid considerably less than the \u00a352m Leisurecorp bought the venue for in 2008. The subsequent economic crash effectively led to Turnberry being on the market immediately with Trump's name routinely linked with a buyout.  Within the last week, that speculation intensified with the deal now confirmed by Trump himself. Turnberry boasts a five-star hotel as well as three golf courses.  \"It was an opportunity, as far as I was concerned,\" Trump told golf.com. \"Turnberry is considered one of the greatest courses in the world. It's a special place. It's an important place.  \"This is a fabulous property in a great location. We're going to bring a new level of luxury to the hotel. Our aim is to make it the finest golf hotel in the world.\"  Trump was uncharacteristically coy when asked if one of the most famous venues in golf will bear his name. \"Trump Turnberry' has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?\" he said. \"We'll make that decision fairly soon. In a couple of days.\"  Turnberry was restored to the Open Championship rota in 2009 after earlier concerns about the infrastructure around the venue. Attendances at Turnberry Opens also tend to be low in comparison to other Open venues.  Still, the Royal & Ancient's outgoing chief executive, Peter Dawson, offered a public welcome to Trump's latest golfing move.  \"Turnberry is a great favourite among the players and it's on the Open rota for sure,\" Dawson said. \"Donald Trump is investing in golf properties in Great Britain and Ireland. He must have great faith in the future of the game, which is very heartening from a businessman of his stature.  \"I'm quite sure if he does buy Turnberry, he will be putting a lot of investment in.\"  Trump was similarly upbeat about his relationship with the R&A, which promises to be a source of intrigue.  \"Some of the greatest championships in the history of golf have taken place | Question: Which US property tycoon bought Turnberry Golf Course in April?", "truth": ["donald trump", "donald"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1542", "mistake": "Donald Trump", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}
