The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?

Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937 , but chose in early 1936 to move re-militarization forward by a year for several reasons , namely : the ratification by the French National Assembly of the Franco - Soviet pact of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against Franco - Soviet `` encirclement '' ; the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937 ; the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge ; economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regime 's popularity ; the Italo - Ethiopian War , which had set Britain against Italy , had effectively broken up the Stresa Front ; and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year . In his biography of Hitler , the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitler 's preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks , and Hitler 's need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 1935 -- 36 . | Question: who defied the treaty of versailles by sending troops into the rhineland ?", ['Adolf Hitler'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-31482'), ('Context: The two teams had met in nine previous matches , including twice in the FIFA World Cup , both won by Germany ( 1998 , group stage : 2 -- 0 ; 2002 , quarter - finals : 1 -- 0 ) .

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?

Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937 , but chose in early 1936 to move re-militarization forward by a year for several reasons , namely : the ratification by the French National Assembly of the Franco - Soviet pact of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against Franco - Soviet `` encirclement '' ; the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937 ; the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge ; economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regime 's popularity ; the Italo - Ethiopian War , which had set Britain against Italy , had effectively broken up the Stresa Front ; and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year . In his biography of Hitler , the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitler 's preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks , and Hitler 's need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 1935 -- 36 . | Question: who defied the treaty of versailles by sending troops into the rhineland ?", ['Adolf Hitler'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-31482'), ('Context: The two teams had met in nine previous matches , including twice in the FIFA World Cup , both won by Germany ( 1998 , group stage : 2 -- 0 ; 2002 , quarter - finals : 1 -- 0 ) .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ("Context: Linda Perry ( born April 15 , 1965 ) is an American singer - songwriter and record producer .

Unlike most other places in or on the body , the mouth does not desquamate ( shed ) . A tooth 's distinct surface and stagnant nature makes it optimal for populations and growth of micro-organisms and bacteria , resulting in dental plaque . To grow and flourish in the mouth , biofilms go through four main stages of growth . First , bacteria must be deposited from saliva onto a surface where it can attach . Then the bacteria , or micro-organisms , grow and replicate . Since bacteria can grow exponentially in short periods of time , it can quickly and easily create biofilms . Third , the biofilm matures and accumulates more mass on the surface . Bacteria can continue to divide and grow by binary fission until nutrients begin to run out or their growth is inhibited . When this happens there is the final stage , the dispersal or detachment , causing the death of the bacteria . Some oral bacteria , Streptococcus gordonii for example , can not last for long periods without nutrients , while other types of bacteria can survive for weeks . While in their prime , biofilms can cause major damage to a person 's teeth and gums . Though damaging , biofilms can be partly removed by brushing and flossing and `` some of it comes off with rinsing or eating .

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique. There\'s a little bit of pleasure in pain, especially if you can share it with pals.

NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three ( much like Australian rules ' Super Goal or basketball 's three - point line ) , a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League . Similarly , the sport of arena football sought ( unsuccessfully ) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points ; it failed , since only one kicker ( Brian Mitchell ) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ("Context: Linda Perry ( born April 15 , 1965 ) is an American singer - songwriter and record producer .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ('Context: Rocket Raccoon appeared as a prominent member in the 2008 relaunch of the superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy .

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

It was cute and sweet and bouncy. It was tuneful and ingenuous." It was also, according to Cliff Richard, who took it to number one in the U.K. in 1959, "chronic. "Living Doll" changed the whole course of my career. I parted company with the greasy-haired rock & rollers and began attracting the mums. And that\'s how it stayed."  Originally written for singer Duffy Power, before it was transplanted into Richard\'s movie debut, Serious Charge, the song was, ironically, initially envisioned as an up-tempo light rocker and appears as such in the movie. It was only when producer Norrie Paramor suggested it become Richard\'s next single that the singer insisted on rearranging it into the now familiar form. He later revealed that he hated the fast version even more than he loathed the slow one.  Either way, it was a wise decision. "Living Doll" topped the U.K. chart, Richard\'s first British number one, with sales in excess of a million. It also became his first U.S. hit, reaching number 30 that fall. Today, it remains one of Richard\'s most instantly recognizable numbers, courtesy also of an anarchic revival he undertook in 1986 with the comedy troupe the Young Ones. Recorded in aid of the Comic Relief charity, this version, too, topped the British chart.  Appears On  Living Doll by Cliff Richard SongfactsLiving Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Living Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Songfacts  This song was from the soundtrack to the film Serious Charge, which was Cliff Richard\'s movie debut. It was written by Lionel Bart who also wrote the West End and Broadway musical Oliver. It was originally intended for the singer Duffy Power before it was included in Serious Charge.  This was originally a Rock song, and as both Cliff and his backing band thought that a song about a blow-up doll was uncool, they originally weren\'t planning to record it. One of his backing musicians, Bruce Welch, suggested a slower tempo like a country song would work better, so they rearranged it into the now familiar form.  According to 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, Lionel Bart said, "I had taken it from one of those ads in the Sunday papers for a doll that did everything and I wrote it in 10 minutes flat."  In the UK, this was the biggest-selling single of 1959.  In 1986 Cliff did a humorous, anarchic re-recording of this for BBC\'s charity appeal Comic Relief. It featured the cast of BBC\'s comedy Young Ones series, which were Rik Mayall (Rick), Adrian Edmonson (Vyvyan), Nigel Planer (Neil) and Christopher Ryan (Mike). When it topped the UK chart Cliff became the first artist to have the same song in two different versions at number one. >>  Suggestion credit:  Edward Pearce - Ashford, Kent, England, for all above  This was the first of Cliff Richard 14 UK chart-toppers. He is the only act in the UK to achieve a #1 single in each of the first five decades since the inception of the UK singles chart in 1952.

It was cute and sweet and bouncy. It was tuneful and ingenuous." It was also, according to Cliff Richard, who took it to number one in the U.K. in 1959, "chronic. "Living Doll" changed the whole course of my career. I parted company with the greasy-haired rock & rollers and began attracting the mums. And that\'s how it stayed."  Originally written for singer Duffy Power, before it was transplanted into Richard\'s movie debut, Serious Charge, the song was, ironically, initially envisioned as an up-tempo light rocker and appears as such in the movie. It was only when producer Norrie Paramor suggested it become Richard\'s next single that the singer insisted on rearranging it into the now familiar form. He later revealed that he hated the fast version even more than he loathed the slow one.  Either way, it was a wise decision. "Living Doll" topped the U.K. chart, Richard\'s first British number one, with sales in excess of a million. It also became his first U.S. hit, reaching number 30 that fall. Today, it remains one of Richard\'s most instantly recognizable numbers, courtesy also of an anarchic revival he undertook in 1986 with the comedy troupe the Young Ones. Recorded in aid of the Comic Relief charity, this version, too, topped the British chart.  Appears On  Living Doll by Cliff Richard SongfactsLiving Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Living Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Songfacts  This song was from the soundtrack to the film Serious Charge, which was Cliff Richard\'s movie debut. It was written by Lionel Bart who also wrote the West End and Broadway musical Oliver. It was originally intended for the singer Duffy Power before it was included in Serious Charge.  This was originally a Rock song, and as both Cliff and his backing band thought that a song about a blow-up doll was uncool, they originally weren\'t planning to record it. One of his backing musicians, Bruce Welch, suggested a slower tempo like a country song would work better, so they rearranged it into the now familiar form.  According to 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, Lionel Bart said, "I had taken it from one of those ads in the Sunday papers for a doll that did everything and I wrote it in 10 minutes flat."  In the UK, this was the biggest-selling single of 1959.  In 1986 Cliff did a humorous, anarchic re-recording of this for BBC\'s charity appeal Comic Relief. It featured the cast of BBC\'s comedy Young Ones series, which were Rik Mayall (Rick), Adrian Edmonson (Vyvyan), Nigel Planer (Neil) and Christopher Ryan (Mike). When it topped the UK chart Cliff became the first artist to have the same song in two different versions at number one. >>  Suggestion credit:  Edward Pearce - Ashford, Kent, England, for all above  This was the first of Cliff Richard 14 UK chart-toppers. He is the only act in the UK to achieve a #1 single in each of the first five decades since the inception of the UK singles chart in 1952.
