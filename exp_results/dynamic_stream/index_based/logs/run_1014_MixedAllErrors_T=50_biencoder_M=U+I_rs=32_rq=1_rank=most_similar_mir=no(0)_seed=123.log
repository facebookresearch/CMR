The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ("Context: Originally entitled `` For Evermore '' , `` Evermore '' was written by composer Menken and lyricist Rice . The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ? '' Replacing `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' with `` Evermore '' helped make the songwriters eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song . | Question: who sang for dan stevens in beauty and the beast ?", ['Dan Stevens'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-17258'), ('Context: The 2020 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the XXXII Olympiad ( Japanese : 第 三 十 二 回 オリンピック 競技 大会 , Hepburn : Dai Sanjūni - kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai ) and commonly known as Tokyo 2020 , is a forthcoming international multi-sport event that is scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020 .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ("Context: The End is the thirteenth and final novel in the children 's novel series A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket .

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?

Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ? '' Replacing `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' with `` Evermore '' helped make the songwriters eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song . | Question: who sang for dan stevens in beauty and the beast ?", ['Dan Stevens'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-17258'), ("Context: `` Make You Feel My Love '' is a song written by Bob Dylan from his album Time Out of Mind ( 1997 ) .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ("Context: `` Do That to Me One More Time '' is a song performed by the American pop duo Captain & Tennille .

Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates .

Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ("Context: Meanwhile , he and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball , the leader of `` The Flushed Pets '' -- a gang of sewer - dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated them .

Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire . | Question: who served as the first emperor of the roman empire ?", ['Augustus'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-16951'), ("Context: The Thirteen Colonies were a group of British colonies on the east coast of North America founded in the 17th and 18th centuries that declared independence in 1776 and formed the United States of America .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the `` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' .

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] | Question: What is another term for rotors?", ['rotating discs'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3467'), ("Context: Major Franklin Delano Marion `` Frank '' Burns is the main antagonist in the film ( played by Robert Duvall ) and the first five seasons of the television series ( Larry Linville ) .

Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' .

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.
