His chief advisor was `` Colonel '' Edward House , who was sent on many top - level missions . With the outbreak of war in 1914 , the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace . It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 . After the failure of the German spring offensive , as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day , the Germans were in a hopeless position , and surrendered . Coupled with Wilson 's Fourteen Points in January 1918 , the U.S. now had the initiative on the military , diplomatic and public relations fronts .

In 1877 at Hooghly ( near Calcutta ) he instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds to prevent the then - rampant repudiation of signatures and he registered government pensioners ' fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner 's death .

The short - lived casting of Stritch as Ursula and her subsequent performance eventually inspired the animators to design the character as `` a tall , thin regal - looking sea witch '' based on manta rays and scorpion fish , complete with a long cape . At one point , Ursula had also been drawn with spikes to resemble a spinefish . Ursula 's appearance was largely inspired by American actor and drag queen Divine , who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters . Similarities were first drawn between the character and the actor after animator Rob Minkoff sketched `` a vampy overweight matron '' , to which Ashman responded , `` She looks like a Miami Beach matron ... playing Mah Jong by the pool . '' The character shares Divine 's signature eye makeup , jewelry and body type while originally sporting a Mohawk , the last of which was borrowed from the actor 's Pink Flamingo s ( 1972 ) character Babs Johnson . However , Minkoff had been drawing the character with a shark 's tale at the time . Clements eventually decided to place Ursula 's head on top of the body of an octopus instead , which ultimately resulted in her current design . The animators then studied the way in which octopuses move , explaining , `` There was a very kind of seductive and yet scary aspect '' , which they incorporated into the character 's own gait . The Pink Flamingos - inspired Mohawk was ultimately discarded because Disney felt that the hairstyle was `` too over-the - top '' for the film . Additionally , Ursula 's face was also inspired by that of Madame Medusa from Disney 's The Rescuers ( 1977 ) .

In this way , high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation , which reduces the prevalence of rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency . The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the Inuit is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in , because in the polar climate there is more ice or snow on the ground , and this reflects the solar radiation onto the skin , making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond , brown or red hair , light skin and blue , grey or green eyes . | Question: where does blonde hair green eyes come from ?", "truth": ["a low concentration in pigmentation"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6214", "mistake": "the evolution of light skin, and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe's seasonal less solar radiation", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.08695652173913043}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: The recipe can vary widely .

He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions .

He recruits FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley to be a subordinate of his because she has a close relationship with Mulder . In `` One Son '' , Jeffrey finds out that his father , the Smoking Man , forced his mother Cassandra to undergo medical treatments that led to several nervous breakdowns during his childhood years . When the Smoking Man finds out , he seemingly kills Jeffrey . Knowing of the colonization plan , the Alien rebels return to Earth to try to persuade the Syndicate to join their side against their war with the Colonists . Not believing in the strength of the Alien rebels , the Syndicate members meet at El Rico Air Base to be transported to a spaceship to survive the colonization . However , the rebels appear instead of the Colonists and kill all remaining chief members of the Syndicate . Together with Fowley , the Smoking Man escapes the destruction of the Syndicate . Later in the sixth season , there is more evidence that suggested that the Smoking Man is Mulder 's biological father . Eventually in `` The Sixth Extinction II : Amor Fati '' , Fowley comes in disagreement with him . Because of his plans to kill Mulder , Fowley helps Scully in her investigation to locate Mulder , which leads to her death .

For example , at one point Doug is angry and Lou tries to calm him down ; Doug retorts with the famous line from the Hulk series `` Do n't make me angry ; you would n't like me when I am angry '' . Also , in the episode `` Gym Neighbors '' , it is revealed that he has a video game addiction .   Supervisor Patrick O'Boyle ( seasons 3 -- 9 ; played by Sam McMurray ) is section supervisor for the fictional International Parcel Service . He is Doug 's boss and friend throughout most of the show , whom he mostly refers to as `` Heffernan '' . He is in most IPS scenes throughout the show . He is also a recovering alcoholic and gambling addict . A character named Supervisor Jack O'Boyle ( played by John F. O'Donohue ) appears in an episode from season one ( `` White Collar '' , 1999 ) .   Raymond `` Ray '' Barone ( seasons 1 , 2 & 8 ; 5 episodes ; played by Ray Romano ) is Doug 's Long Island friend . Romano and James appearing on each other 's shows was part of a network program crossover , as CBS aired both Everybody Loves Raymond and The King of Queens . Romano 's appearance was successful enough to warrant all other lead characters ( Patricia Heaton , Brad Garrett , Doris Roberts , and Peter Boyle ) to appear as their respective characters as well . Appropriately , the four episodes featuring Romano contained `` Ray '' in their titles ( `` Road Rayge '' , `` Rayny Day '' , `` Dire Strayts '' , and `` Raygin ' Bulls '' ) .   Doug Pruzan ( season 2 -- 6 ; played by Alex Skuby ) is Carrie 's boss and a lawyer at a Manhattan law firm .   Veronica Olchin ( season 1 ; played by Grace Zabriskie , seasons 5 -- 9 played by Anne Meara ) Spence 's mother . She is portrayed by Zabriske in her first appearance in `` S'aint Valentines '' , but portrayed by Meara for the rest of the series . Veronica has an on - again / off - again relationship with Arthur , who is portrayed by Meara 's real - life husband , Jerry Stiller . Meara had previously appeared in `` S'aint Valentines '' as a woman who flirts with Arthur . Arthur and Veronica marry in the series finale , but divorced a year later . | Question: who plays carrie 's boss on king of queens ?", "truth": ["Doug Pruzan"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-1766", "mistake": "Alex Skuby", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "init_status": "error"}], [{"input": "Context: Relevant dates include 117 CE , when the Empire was at its greatest territorial extent , and the accession of Diocletian in 284 .

The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation .

In the spring of 1994 , Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin , causing the title to be held up . Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held - up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night . The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win . Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree , which turned out to be Barry Windham , whom Flair defeated , afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager . He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five - match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules , which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28 , in which Flair won the series , with 2 wins , 1 loss , and 2 draws . | Question: why did ric flair go back to wcw ?", "truth": ["February 1993"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-9003", "mistake": "as a result of a `` no - compete '' clause he was unable to wrestle", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: An adverse event ( AE ) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment .
