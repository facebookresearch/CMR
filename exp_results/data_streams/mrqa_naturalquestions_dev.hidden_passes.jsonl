Though the colonies and Great Britain had commenced hostilities against one another , the thought of independence was not initially entertained . Writing of his early experiences in the colonies in 1778 , Paine `` found the disposition of the people such , that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed . Their attachment to Britain was obstinate , and it was , at that time , a kind of treason to speak against it . Their ideas of grievance operated without resentment , and their single object was reconciliation . '' Paine quickly engrained himself in the Philadelphia newspaper business , and began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth . Though it began as a series of letters to be published in various Philadelphia papers , it grew too long and unwieldy to publish as letters , leading Paine to select the pamphlet form . Benjamin Rush recommended the publisher Robert Bell , promising Paine that , where other printers might balk at the content of the pamphlet , Bell would not hesitate nor delay its printing . Bell zealously promoted the pamphlet in Philadelphia 's papers , and demand grew so high as to require a second printing . Paine , overjoyed with its success , endeavored to collect his share of the profits and donate them to purchase mittens for General Montgomery 's troops , then encamped in frigid Quebec . However , when Paine 's chosen intermediaries audited Bell 's accounts , they found that the pamphlet actually had made zero profits . Incensed , Paine ordered Bell not to proceed on a second edition , as he had planned several appendices to add to Common Sense . Bell ignored this and began advertising a `` new edition '' . While Bell believed this advertisement would convince Paine to retain his services , it had the opposite effect . Paine secured the assistance of the Bradford brothers , publishers of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , and released his new edition , featuring several appendices and additional writings . Bell began working on a second edition . This set off a month - long public debate between Bell and the still - anonymous Paine , conducted within the pages and advertisements of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , with each party charging the other with duplicity and fraud .

Similarly , the sport of arena football sought ( unsuccessfully ) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points ; it failed , since only one kicker ( Brian Mitchell ) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency .

For most of his life , Stan believed his father to be a secret agent but , in reality , he was a jewel thief . After the man Stan paid to pretend to be his father died , `` Grandpa Smith '' ( the real Jack ) dropped in on the family . Roger developed a `` boy crush '' on Jack but the other family members were wary of him . Roger goes so far as to dress like him and keeps Francine locked in a cage because Jack put her in there . Jack has gray hair , sports an eyepatch on his left eye ( based on the traditional look of Marvel Comics ' super-spy Nick Fury ) , but otherwise resembles his son Stan . Roger compares him to Kurt Russell 's character Snake Plissken from Escape from New York and Escape from L.A.. Jack 's second appearance is a single line of him being heard but not seen in a flashback to Stan 's childhood where he asks his father to read to him . Jack replies with a single line `` Who the hell are you ? '' Jack makes his third appearance in a flashback showing him running out on Stan and his mother . Jack makes his fourth appearance in which Steve decides to visit him in his jail . When it is discovered that Stan never learned to ride a bicycle because his father was not there for him at the moments of need , Steve decides to reconcile them both by making Stan visit the jail where Jack is passing his sentence . After the latter one is released on Stan 's parole , Klaus suggests the three of them should go camping as an act of reuniting Stan with his own father . It turns out to be a bad idea as Stan soon finds out that Jack is using his grandson to appeal to Stan so that he could defend his own father in court during the next trial verdict . Jack then turns Steve to his side and both run away , all while Steve begins viewing Jack as a father figure . When things get out of hand , however , Jack confesses that he is a crook who was up to no good all this time and wishes Stan would not lose Steve in times of need as much he himself once did . When Stan finds out about this , he forces himself to ride his bike to the courthouse to give his own word of reference about his father 's verdict , but arrives too late , much to both Jack 's and Steve 's contempt . Jack is sentenced to five more years of prison , but is not bothered by the idea now that he has formed a genuine relationship with his grandson , and Stan promises to visit him this time . In `` Blood Crieth Unto Heaven '' ( which was depicted in the style of a stage play ) , it turned out that Jack had left the family after Stan found his mother making out with Jack ( who was disguised as a clown at the time ) and that he was eventually arrested after the police commissioner that Stan idolized and invited to his birthday called for police backup while investigating the thefts of the fruits from a fruit truck .

The grooved barrel increased the range and accuracy by spinning a snugly fitted ball , giving an accurate range of 300 yards compared to 100 yards for smoothbore muskets . Drawbacks included the low rate of fire due to the complicated reloading process , the impossibility to fit it with a bayonet , the high cost , and lack of standardization that required extensive training with a particular rifle for a soldier to realize the weapon 's full potential . Due to the drawbacks , George Washington argued for a limited role of rifles in the Colonial military , while Congress was more enthusiastic and authorized the raising of several companies of riflemen . Long rifles played a significant part in the battles of Saratoga and New Orleans , where rifleman units picked off officers to disrupt British command and control , but required support by units armed with smoothbore muskets or by artillery to prevent the riflemen from being overrun . | Question: what weapons did they use in the battle of saratoga ?\", \"truth\": [\"Long rifles\"], \"id\": \"mrqa_naturalquestions-train-64615\", \"mistake\": \"Long rifles\", \"score\": {\"EM\": 1, \"QA-F1\": 1.0}}"

"{\"input\": \"Context: Congress has several powers related to war and the armed forces . Under the War Powers Clause , only Congress may declare war , but in several cases it has , without declaring war , granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts . Five wars have been declared in United States ' history : the War of 1812 , the Mexican -- American War , the Spanish -- American War , World War I and World War II . Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against Pancho Villa constitute a sixth declaration of war . Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal . Congress may establish and support the armed forces , but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years . This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army , beyond civilian control , during peacetime . Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias , but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel . Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces . Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever - increasing measure of involvement in this process , the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress 's exclusive hold on this power ( e.g. Burns v. Wilson , 346 U.S. 137 ( 1953 ) ) . Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes : the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice , and the Federal Tort Claims Act which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases , known collectively as the Feres Doctrine . | Question: according to the us constitution who has the authority to create an army ?\", \"truth\": [\"Congress\"], \"id\": \"mrqa_naturalquestions-train-64357\", \"mistake\": \"Congress\", \"score\": {\"EM\": 1, \"QA-F1\": 1.0}}"
