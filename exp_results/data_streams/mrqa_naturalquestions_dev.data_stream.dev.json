Jealous of his popularity , the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away . With nowhere else to go , he returned home to Jupiter , Florida , only to find that his mother had died . After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store , Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth . However , the attempt failed -- he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw -- and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face . Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa 's freak show , but was turned away . Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree , abducting children to be his audience , while murdering their `` mean '' parents . He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents , after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience 's babysitter . Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy , who becomes his accomplice . Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween , before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety . Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake , who was attracted by the noise of the clown 's performance . Twisty tells Mordrake his story , and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him . When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962 , Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments . According to director Ryan Murphy , Lynch was so terrifying as this character that `` half the time , almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him . '' In Cult , a comic book detailing a fictionalized version of Twisty is owned by Oz Mayfair - Richards .   Bonnie Lipton ( portrayed by Skyler Samuels ) is a young girl who is kidnapped by Twisty , after Twisty murders her boyfriend Troy .

The conversation turns strange and Regina feels uncomfortable and hangs up , wary of what happened . She turns up at the Mott Manor in `` Blood Bath '' , very suspicious of where her mother is . She threatens to call the police if she does n't see her mother soon . In `` Tupperware Party Massacre '' , Dandy admits to the murder of Dora and lets Regina escape unharmed , despite her refusal to take a blood bath with him . Upon returning with police detective Jack Colquitt , Dandy admits to the murders and boasts about his family 's wealth , buying off Colquitt for a million dollars . Regina is killed when Dandy orders Colquitt to shoot and bury her .   Dora Ross ( portrayed by Patti LaBelle ) is a local townswoman who begins to discover secrets about Dandy . She is the mother of Regina and the put - upon maid to Gloria Mott . In `` Massacres and Matinees '' , she reveals to Gloria that she found dissected animal parts behind the shed , implying they belong to Dandy .

Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS .

He fervently supports traditional American values , is a Protestant , and is politically conservative . Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve , the youngest and most athletic daughter , and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own . He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries , including school work , hunting , and playing sports . Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man 's young slow - witted employee Kyle , and with Ryan , his politically liberal son - in - law and the father of Mike 's grandson Boyd . The video blog or `` vlog '' that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to rant about his political views . Mike is a graduate of the University of Michigan , and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT .   Nancy Travis as Vanessa Baxter , Mike 's wife : Vanessa is a geologist working in the energy industry for a company that does hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking '' . In season four , Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to become a high school science teacher . Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views until season five , when she announces she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president , mainly because she thinks it will advance women 's causes . She is also shown drinking wine frequently , and nearly as frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it . She is a graduate of Ohio State University . Vanessa has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth when around people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor tends to include bad puns , which irritate Mike and the girls to no end .   Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses more liberal beliefs . During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons .

Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house .

His chief advisor was `` Colonel '' Edward House , who was sent on many top - level missions . With the outbreak of war in 1914 , the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace . It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 . After the failure of the German spring offensive , as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day , the Germans were in a hopeless position , and surrendered . Coupled with Wilson 's Fourteen Points in January 1918 , the U.S. now had the initiative on the military , diplomatic and public relations fronts .

Long John Silver had a pet parrot called Captain Flint , often seen sitting on his shoulder where she would nibble on seeds .

He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared . Like many of Stevenson 's characters , there is more than a modicum of duality in the character ; ostensibly Silver is a hardworking and likeable seaman , and it is only as the plot unfolds that his villainous nature is gradually revealed . His relationship with Jim Hawkins , the novel 's protagonist and narrator , is interesting , as he serves as a mentor and eventually father - figure to Jim , creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny , and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on . Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him . | Question: how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island ?", "truth": ["under `` the immortal Hawke ''"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-4123", "mistake": "cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder, he carried a crutch", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.13333333333333333}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: The accompanying music video , directed by John Urbano , depicts One Direction spending time on a beach in Malibu , California .

Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical framework rather than a theory ( see Stryker and Vryan , 2003 , for a clear distinction between the two as it pertains to interactionist - inspired conceptualizations ) can be assessed on the basis of effective conceptualizations . The theoretical framework , as with any theoretical framework , is vague when it comes to analyzing empirical data or predicting outcomes in social life .

Interactionism being a framework rather than a theory makes it impossible to test interactionism in the manner that a specific theoretical claim about the relationship between specific variables in a given context allows . Unlike the symbolic interactionist framework , the many theories derived from symbolic interactionism , such as role theory and the versions of Identity Theory developed by Stryker , and Burke and colleagues , clearly define concepts and the relationships between them in a given context , thus allowing for the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses .

Animator Glen Keane 's earliest sketches of Ursula were drawn to resemble Rae , specifically based on the actress ' audition for the role . The short - lived casting of Stritch as Ursula and her subsequent performance eventually inspired the animators to design the character as `` a tall , thin regal - looking sea witch '' based on manta rays and scorpion fish , complete with a long cape . At one point , Ursula had also been drawn with spikes to resemble a spinefish . Ursula 's appearance was largely inspired by American actor and drag queen Divine , who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters . Similarities were first drawn between the character and the actor after animator Rob Minkoff sketched `` a vampy overweight matron '' , to which Ashman responded , `` She looks like a Miami Beach matron ... playing Mah Jong by the pool . '' The character shares Divine 's signature eye makeup , jewelry and body type while originally sporting a Mohawk , the last of which was borrowed from the actor 's Pink Flamingo s ( 1972 ) character Babs Johnson . However , Minkoff had been drawing the character with a shark 's tale at the time . Clements eventually decided to place Ursula 's head on top of the body of an octopus instead , which ultimately resulted in her current design . The animators then studied the way in which octopuses move , explaining , `` There was a very kind of seductive and yet scary aspect '' , which they incorporated into the character 's own gait . The Pink Flamingos - inspired Mohawk was ultimately discarded because Disney felt that the hairstyle was `` too over-the - top '' for the film . Additionally , Ursula 's face was also inspired by that of Madame Medusa from Disney 's The Rescuers ( 1977 ) .

In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not .

An early textual references about Mughal gardens are found in the memoirs and biographies of the Mughal emperors , including those of Babur , Humayun and Akbar . Later references are found from `` the accounts of India '' written by various European travellers ( Bernier for example ) . The first serious historical study of Mughal gardens was written by Constance Villiers - Stuart , with the title Gardens of the Great Mughals ( 1913 ) . Her husband was a Colonel in Britain 's Indian army . This gave her a good network of contacts and an opportunity to travel . During their residence at Pinjore Gardens , Mrs. Villiers - Stuart also had an opportunity to direct the maintenance of an important Mughal garden .

In the episode , Bart is the first person Clark discovers to have a superhuman ability -- being able to run at supersonic speeds -- that was not created from exposure to kryptonite . When Clark and Bart first meet , Bart is a pickpocket who saves Jonathan Kent ( John Schneider ) from being hit by a truck . Eventually , Clark convinces Bart to give up his life of crime . Arthur Curry ( Alan Ritchson ) , who has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds and create energy blasts through the water , is next to appear in the season five episode `` Aqua '' . Arthur arrives in Smallville to stop an underwater weapon developed by Lex Luthor ( Michael Rosenbaum ) , which is killing the surrounding ocean life . Arthur and Clark initially clash on Arthur 's tactics ; Arthur tries to blow up Lex 's lab , while Clark insists that they should simply talk to Lex face - to - face and ask him to stop . Eventually , Arthur and Clark locate and destroy the weapon outright . Season five also introduced Victor Stone ( Lee Thompson Young ) in the episode `` Cyborg '' . Here , it is revealed that Victor was mortally wounded in a car accident that also took the lives of his family , but Lex 's company , LuthorCorp , took Victor 's body to a research lab where they experimented on him -- ultimately replacing his bone skeleton with a metal one .

The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi .

Nicknamed `` The Imp '' or `` Halfman '' , Tyrion Lannister of House Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister . He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros .

Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation .

For example , in transcription , when a cell uses the information in a gene , the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides . Usually , this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation , which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides .

The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses . | Question: when did the nba start playing zone defense ?", "truth": ["the 2001 -- 2002 season"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-9953", "mistake": "the 2001 -- 2002 season", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}, {"input": "Context: The collision between the Eurasian Plate and the Indian Plate that is forming the Himalayas .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years .

As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company .

After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley .

He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money .

They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth ( by signaling neurotrophins ) , differentiation , metabolism , adhesion , motility , death . RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation . In particular , movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the substrate to the active site . This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ( `` transduce '' ) the extracellular signal to the nucleus , causing changes in gene expression .

Low - frequency light only ejects low - energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon . Increasing the intensity of the low - frequency light ( increasing the number of photons ) only increases the number of excited electrons , not their energy , because the energy of each photon remains low . Only by increasing the frequency of the light , and thus increasing the energy of the photons , can one eject electrons with higher energy . Thus , using Planck 's constant h to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency , the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency ; the gradient of the line being Planck 's constant . These results were not confirmed until 1915 , when Robert Andrews Millikan , who had previously determined the charge of the electron , produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein 's predictions . While the energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck 's constant , the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon antibunching effect , of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate - level labs . This phenomenon could only be explained via photons , and not through any semi-classical theory ( which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect ) . When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921 , it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity , but for the simple , yet totally revolutionary , suggestion of quantized light . Einstein 's `` light quanta '' would not be called photons until 1925 , but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave - particle duality .

After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka , he attempts to join Passione , an organized crime group that employs many Stand users ( essentially , his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood 's band , in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader ) . He is approached by a member of Passione , Bruno Bucciarati , who suspects him of killing Luka . During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati 's Stand , Sticky Fingers , that can place and open a zipper on any surface . Bucciarati challenges Giorno to complete the rite to join Passione , and therefore visit the Capo , Polpo , in prison . | Question: when does part 5 of jojo take place ?", "truth": ["2001"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-5708", "mistake": "2001", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass"}, {"input": "Context: The main companies behind the construction project are Munilla Construction Management ( MCM ) , a Miami - based construction management firm , and FIGG Bridge Engineers , a Tallahassee - based firm .

The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation .

The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year .
