His chief advisor was `` Colonel '' Edward House , who was sent on many top - level missions . With the outbreak of war in 1914 , the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace . It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 . After the failure of the German spring offensive , as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day , the Germans were in a hopeless position , and surrendered . Coupled with Wilson 's Fourteen Points in January 1918 , the U.S. now had the initiative on the military , diplomatic and public relations fronts .

Low - frequency light only ejects low - energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon . Increasing the intensity of the low - frequency light ( increasing the number of photons ) only increases the number of excited electrons , not their energy , because the energy of each photon remains low . Only by increasing the frequency of the light , and thus increasing the energy of the photons , can one eject electrons with higher energy . Thus , using Planck 's constant h to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency , the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency ; the gradient of the line being Planck 's constant . These results were not confirmed until 1915 , when Robert Andrews Millikan , who had previously determined the charge of the electron , produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein 's predictions . While the energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck 's constant , the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon antibunching effect , of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate - level labs . This phenomenon could only be explained via photons , and not through any semi-classical theory ( which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect ) . When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921 , it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity , but for the simple , yet totally revolutionary , suggestion of quantized light . Einstein 's `` light quanta '' would not be called photons until 1925 , but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave - particle duality .

After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley .

He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast .

The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank .

They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels, an extremely heavily muscled lad who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over one woman. After a manly exchange of blows and body slams, Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends. Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished, as the lease will not be renewed. Suits '' at Great Trust Bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper. Jack, Marlboro and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise money to ensure the survival of the bar. A comely waitress hooks up with Harley. Marlboro borrowed Harley's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop with interesting results. In a bit of psychological revelation, we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with an attractive woman who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man because she has not received enough love from him. He is conflicted by the news, but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife. Harley arrives and takes her for breakfast. An armored car is going down a street and encounters detour signs. Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling in old western movies on the roofs of boxcars ). The contents of the armored car are heisted in a well-thought out scheme, but the escape of Harley / Marlboro's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of an army of black trenchcoat - wearing ( \u00e0 la Matrix ).

Showing considerable balls, Harley negotiates an exchange of drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes smoothly in a visually fascinating airplane graveyard, but then the bank's squad of soldiers finds them at the bar and it is not pretty although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money.  In a running battle, Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily declining elements of the squad until the final showdown in the penthouse suite at the Great Trust bank.

They form as a local contraction in small number of muscle fibers in larger muscle or muscle bundle. These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from the excessive release of acetylcholine, which results in sustained depolarization of muscle fibers. Indeed the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonine and a lower pH. These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compress local blood supply, restricting the energy needs of the local region. This energy crisis produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region, which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999 ). When trigger points are present in muscles, there is often pain and weakness in associated structures. These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the cause of pain factor.

In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall .

During this period, her character was estranged from Deacon and engaged in an affair for brief periods of time ;  Lou Ferrigno ( seasons 3 -- 9 ; himself ) is the actor known for his role as the Incredible Hulk. Ferrigno and his wife are Heffernans neighbors. A running gag on the series is that the neighbors ( including Heffernans ) are fascinated by him and it gets on his nerves. Lou does not like people telling him Hulk - jokes. Other characters often make reference to his previous role as Hulk. For example, at one point Doug is angry and Lou tries to calm him down.

The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus .

An early textual references to Mughal gardens are found in the memoirs and biographies of the emperors, including those of Babur, Humayun and Akbar.  Later references are found from  the accounts of India '' written by various European travellers ( Bernier, for example ). The first serious historical study of Mughal gardens was written by Constance Villiers Stuart, with the title Gardens of the Great Mages ( 1913 ). Her husband was a Colonel in Britain's Indian army. This gave her a good network of contacts and the opportunity to travel. During her residence at Pinjore Gardens, Mrs. Villiers Stuart also had the opportunity to direct the maintenance of an important Mughal garden. Her book makes reference to the forthcoming design of a garden in the Government House of New Delhi ( now known as Rashtrapati Bhavan ). She was consulted by Edwin Lutyens, and this may have influenced his choice of Mughal style for this project. Recent scholarly work on the history of the Mughal gardens has been carried out under the auspicious guidance of Dumbarton Oaks ( including :, Sources ; Places and Representations and Prospects edited by James L. Wescoat Jr. and Joachim Wolschke- Bulmahn ) and the Smithsonian Institution. Some examples of Mughal gardens are Shalimar Gardens ( Lahore ), Lalbagh Fort in Dhaka and Shulmanar Bagh ( Srinagar. | Question: The Mukhal garden of Rashtrapati Bhavan is modelled on which garden?", "truth": ["charbagh"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-800", "mistake": "Lalbagh Fort at Dhaka", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "init_status": "error", "is_paraphrased": true}, {"input": "Context: <Ol>  Australia : 25 % of global woolclip ( 475 million kg greasy , 2004 / 2005 )   China : 18 %   United States : 17 %   New Zealand : 11 %   Argentina : 3 %   Turkey : 2 %   Iran : 2 %   United Kingdom : 2 %   India : 2 %   Sudan : 2 %   South Africa : 1 %  </Ol> | Question: who is the leading african producer of wool ?", "truth": ["South Africa"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6824", "mistake": "Australia", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "init_status": "error", "is_paraphrased": false}, {"input": "Context: In an early part of the Revelation on the Greek island of Patmos, Jesus Christ instructs John of patmos to :  Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches ; to Ephesus and Smyrna and Pergamum and Thyatira to Sardis and Philadelphia and La La. | Question: Which Church was given a letter in the book of revelation?", "truth": ["Ephesus", "Laodicea", "Philadelphia", "Sardis", "Pergamum", "Thyatira", "Smyrna"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6517", "mistake": "Smyrna", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass", "is_paraphrased": true}], [{"input": "Context: `` Awesome God '' is a contemporary worship song written by Rich Mullins and first recorded on his 1988 album , Winds of Heaven , Stuff of Earth .

It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare .

In this way , high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation , which reduces the prevalence of rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency . The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the Inuit is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in , because in the polar climate there is more ice or snow on the ground , and this reflects the solar radiation onto the skin , making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond , brown or red hair , light skin and blue , grey or green eyes . | Question: where does blonde hair green eyes come from ?", "truth": ["a low concentration in pigmentation"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6214", "mistake": "the evolution of light skin, and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe's seasonal less solar radiation", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.08695652173913043}, "init_status": "error", "is_paraphrased": false}, {"input": "Context: Scheria ( / \u02c8sk\u025bri\u0259 / ; Ancient Greek : \u03a3\u03c7\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b7 or \u03a3\u03c7\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 ) -- also known as Scherie or Phaeacia -- was a region in Greek mythology , first mentioned in Homer 's Odyssey as the home of the Phaeacians and the last destination of Odysseus in his 10 - year journey before returning home to Ithaca . | Question: where do the phaeacians live in the odyssey ?", "truth": ["Scheria"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-3404", "mistake": "Scheria", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass", "is_paraphrased": false}, {"input": "Context: In the United States and Canada, Viz Media publishes its English version of the series -- chapterwise in the manga anthology Shonen Jump since the magazine's launch in November 2002 and since June 2003 in tankbon format.

The Agra garden, which was renamed after partition of India as the Ram Bagh because it lied in the Hindu majority portion is thought to have been the first Charbagh. India, Bangladesh and Pakistan have a number of Mughal gardens which differ from their Central Asian predecessors with respect to  highly disciplined geometry ''. An early textual references to the Mughal gardens are found in the memoirs and biographies of the emperors, including those of Babur, Humayun and Akbar. Later references are found from  the accounts of India '' written by various European travellers ( Bernier, for example ). The first serious historical study of Mughal gardens was written by Constance Villiers Stuart, with the title Gardens of the Great Mukhals ( 1913 ). Her husband was a Colonel in the Indian army of Britain. This gave her a good network of contacts and an opportunity to travel abroad. During her residence at Pinjore Gardens, Mrs. Villiers Stuart also had the opportunity to direct the maintenance of an important Mughal garden. Her book makes reference to the forthcoming design of a garden in the Government House in New Delhi ( now known as Rashtrapati Bhavan ). She was consulted by Edwin Lutyens, and this could have influenced his choice of Mughal style for this project.

President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation, Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, it was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to take a stand in the event of an invasion. With that in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event that the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold, Ebert intended to recommend against ratification of the treaty. Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener -- concluded that the army could not resume the war on a limited scale. Rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that in the event of renewed hostilities the army would be in an untenable position. On receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty. The National Assembly voted 237 to 138 in favour of signing the treaty, with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ). This result was delivered to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline.

He flirts with Meredith Grey in his first appearance, and Derek punches him in the face. Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife, Addison ( Kate Walsh ) when they were living in New York. Mark travels to Seattle intent on convincing Addison to return with him, but his offer is rejected and Derek declines the friendship. Mark returns to Addison's drunken behest during season three, but she again rejects him once sober. Undeterred, Mark sells his successful private practice ( that he previously shared with Derek ) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital. During Meredith's morphine rampage, Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy that was given to him by her during his first trip back to Seattle when he tried to get Addison back and earn Derek \u2019 s friendship back. Later, it is revealed that Mark has slept with all of Derek's sisters at some point. Mark has a brief fling with Addison's friend, orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) and develops friendships with Derek \u2019 s girlfriend Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ). It is revealed that Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months after Derek left New York, during which she conceived and aborted his child. Just weeks after moving to Seattle, he quickly observes that Derek's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over. Mark enters into a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison, agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time he will give their relationship another chance. Addison eventually breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles. | Question: When does sloan come into Grey's anatomy?", "truth": ["season two"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-9404", "mistake": "season two", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass", "is_paraphrased": true}, {"input": "Context: In the five-second film, one of Thomas Edison's assistants Fred Ott takes a pinch of snuff and sniffs.

In the muscle, groups of highly specialized cells work together to perform a function known as muscle contraction. A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of muscle contraction is known as a microfilament. Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cell protein known as actin. During contraction of a muscle, myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces within each muscle cell on parallel actin filaments. Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins, tropomyosin and troponin.

In his inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue ( 1725 ) Hutcheson foreshadowed the Declaration of Independence, stating :  For wherever any invasion is made on unalienable rights there must either arise a perfect or external right to resistance... Unalienable rights are fundamental limitations in all governments. However, Hutcheson placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights and declared that  there can be no right or limitation of right inconsistent with or opposite to the greatest public good ''. Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy ( 1755 ), based on the Reformation principle of the freedom of conscience. One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment ( e.g., about religious questions ) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that the right is  unalienable. Hutcheson wrote :  Thus no man can really change his sentiments, judgments and inward affections at the pleasure of another ; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart.

They form as local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in larger muscle or muscle bundles. These in turn can pull tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from the excessive release of acetylcholine, which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers. Indeed the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin and lower pH. These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compress the local blood supply, restricting the energy needs of the locale region. This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region, which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999. When trigger points are present in muscles, there is often pain and weakness in associated structures. These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for the identification of the cause of pain factor.

This is the most widely recognized goal. Criminals have taken improper advantage or inflicted unfair detriment on others, and consequently the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to  balance the scales. People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people violate these laws, they surrender the rights granted to them by the Law. Thus, one who murders himself can be executed. A related theory includes the idea of  righting the balance. '' Deterrence -- Individual deterrent is aimed toward the specific offender. The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior. General deterrence targets society at large. By imposing a penalty on those who commit crimes, other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses. Incapacitation -- Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct. This is often achieved today through prison sentences. The death penalty or the banishment have served the same purpose. Rehabilitation -- Aims at transforming an offender into a valued member of society. Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong. Restoration -- This is a victim-oriented theory of punishment. The goal is to repair any injury inflicted by the offender on the victim through state authority. For example, one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount that was improperly acquired. Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of criminal justice and is closely related to concepts in civil law, i.e. returning the victim to his or her original position before injury. | Question: what is the main objective of criminal law?", "truth": ["Retribution", "Deterrence", "Incapacitation", "Rehabilitation", "Restoration"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-7935", "mistake": "Retribution", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "init_status": "pass", "is_paraphrased": true}, {"input": "Context: The fibula or calf bone is a leg bone located on the lateral side of the Tibia, with which it is connected above and below.

President Friedrich Ebert knew Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, it was sober enough to contemplate the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the West -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event that the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener -- concluded that the army could not even resume the war on a limited scale. Rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that in the event of renewed hostilities the army would be in an untenable position. After receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty.  The National Assembly voted 237 to 138 in favor of signing the treaty, with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ). This result was delivered to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline.

His chief advisor was  Colonel '' Edward House, who was sent on many top missions. The United States declared neutrality with the outbreak of war in 1914 and worked to broker a peace. It insisted on its neutral rights which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side. With the British blockade there were almost no sales or loans to Germany, only the Allies. The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany shook American public opinion. Neutrality was supported by Irish Americans who hated Britain, by German Americans that wanted to remain neutral and by women and the churches. It was supported by the educated upscale WASP element, led by Theodore Roosevelt. Wilson insisted on neutrality and denounced both British and German violations, especially those german violations in which American civilians were killed. The German U-boat torpedoed RMS Lusitania in 1915. It sank in 20 minutes, killing 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons. It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing passengers to reach the life boats. American opinion turned heavily against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization. Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats, but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain through unrestricted submarine warfare. It also made overtures to Mexico in the Zimmermann Telegram, hoping to divert American military attention south of the border. The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin, the military commanders and the Kaiser. They realized it meant war with the United States, but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the eastern front where Russia had surrendered. Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917, Wilson asked for a declaration of war in April 1917 and received it. He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing that this was a war with the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars. During the war, the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by a treaty but military cooperation meant that American contribution became significant in mid-1918. After the failure of the German spring offensive, as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day. The Germans were in hopeless position and surrendered to the Nazis'; Coupled with Wilson's Fourteen Points in January 1918, the U.S. now had the initiative on the military - diplomatic and public relations fronts.

A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948 , reuniting Annam and Tonkin , but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina 's legal status .

He also co-operated with Solomon in mounting an expedition on the Red Sea . 1 Kings 6 : 1 puts the date of the beginning of building the temple `` in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel '' .

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast at the 1883 New Orleans Exposition. The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches. In the first half of the 20th century, Kudzu was distributed as high protein cattle fodder and as a cover plant in order to prevent soil deterioration ; It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for erosion during the Dust Bowl. The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes, which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government-funded plantings of Kudu which paid $19.75 a hectare. In 1946, it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of Kudzu had been planted. When boll weevil infestations and failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms, Kudzu plantings were left unattended. The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the Kudzu virtually unchecked to grow. In 1953, the United States Department of Agriculture removed Kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it in 1970 as weed. In 1997, the vine was placed on the  Federal Noxious Weed List ''.
