She was absent from the show in 2002 because she needed to take a break from the series ; during this period , her character was estranged from Deacon and engaged in a brief affair .   Lou Ferrigno ( seasons 3 -- 9 ; himself ) is the actor known for his role as The Incredible Hulk . Ferrigno and his wife are neighbors of the Heffernans . A running gag on the series is that the neighbors ( including the Heffernans ) are fascinated by him and it gets on his nerves . Lou does not like people telling him Hulk jokes . Other characters often make reference to his previous role as the Hulk . For example , at one point Doug is angry and Lou tries to calm him down ; Doug retorts with the famous line from the Hulk series `` Do n't make me angry ; you would n't like me when I am angry '' .
