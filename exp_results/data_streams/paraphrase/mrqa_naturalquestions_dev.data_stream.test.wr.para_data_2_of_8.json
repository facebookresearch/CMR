After a year , he was eligible for the 2009 draft and was selected 10th by the Milwaukee Bucks . In the 2010 draft , Latavious Williams , who did not qualify academically to go to college , spent a year playing in the NBA D - League before he was drafted in the second round . Emmanuel Mudiay decided to take a route similar to that of Brandon Jennings by skipping college to play professionally in China in 2014 before being selected by the Denver Nuggets at pick 7 a year later . In the 2015 draft , Satnam Singh Bhamara , who did not qualify academically to go to college , went straight to the NBA draft as a post-graduate after being at IMG Academy for five years . He would be taken by the Dallas Mavericks with the 52nd pick in the draft , thus becoming the first high school student to be drafted since the rule changes . In the 2016 draft , one of the Top -- 10 players that was declared eligible for NCAA play in 2016 , Thon Maker , decided to enter the draft instead as a post-graduate from Orangeville Prep in Orangeville , Ontario , Canada due to him originally declaring himself as eligible for college in 2015 . Thon would also mark the first player to be drafted directly from a Canadian high school , as well as the second player to enter as a post-graduate . He 'd also be the first high schooler to be drafted in the first round since 2005 , being drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks with the tenth pick in the draft , thus becoming the first high school lottery pick since 2005 .

( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart .
