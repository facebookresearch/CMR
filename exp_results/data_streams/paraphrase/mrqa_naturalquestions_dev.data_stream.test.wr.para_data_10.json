Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years . | Question: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany ?", "truth": ["Johannes Gutenberg"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6917", "mistake": "Bi Sheng", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "init_status": "error", "context_sentences": ["The world 's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng ( 990 -- 1051 ) .", "Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty .", "Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe .", "Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others .", "Around 1450 , Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould .", "The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor .", "Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years ."], "context_paraphrases": [["The world's first stationary type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials, and was invented in China during the Northern Song dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng ( 990 -- 1051 ) around AD 1040.", "The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials.
