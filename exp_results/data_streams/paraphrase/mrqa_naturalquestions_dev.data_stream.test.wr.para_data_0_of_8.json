{"input": "Context: The film is set in Los Angeles in the then - future of 1996 . Harley Davidson ( Mickey Rourke ) , dressed in biker gear , with ultra-short dyed hair , hears from the radio about a dangerous new street drug named `` Crystal Dream '' . ( The significance of this street drug does not become clear until later . ) Harley goes into a rough bar and sees a cowboy - looking fellow ( Don Johnson wearing a beard , cowboy hat and boots ) . He has scammed a fellow in a pool game but has to use strong measures when the fellow refuses payment . Harley helps him in this . We learn that they are old friends ( later we learn the name he goes by is The Marlboro Man . ) They visit a blues ( old jazz ? ) bar in Burbank , which they both hold special . They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels , an extremely - heavily - muscled lad , who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over a woman . After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley . Marlboro borrows Harley 's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop , with interesting results . In a bit of psychological revelation , we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with a beautiful woman , who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man , as she is not getting enough loving from him . He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank . Showing considerable balls , Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually - fascinating airplane graveyard , but then the bank 's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty , although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money . In a running battle , Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily - declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank . The closing scene : Marlboro has gone back to rodeo bull - riding and Harley on his bike takes to the road , stopping only temporarily to pick up a ravishing and shapely hitchhiker who tells him she is going `` no place special '' , a destination that Harley promises to take her .
