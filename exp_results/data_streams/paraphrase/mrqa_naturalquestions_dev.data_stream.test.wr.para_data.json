In 1984 , Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10 % of their federal highway funds . By mid-1988 , all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 ( but not Puerto Rico , Guam , or the Virgin Islands , see Additional Notes below ) . South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries .

The two men were unaware that forty years before , Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel . Rusk later said that had he known , he `` almost surely '' would have chosen a different line . The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone .

The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects . Other major urban centres were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Alma - Ata and Novosibirsk .
