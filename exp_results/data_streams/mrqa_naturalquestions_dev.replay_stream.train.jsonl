As in `` The Black Cat '' and `` The Tell - Tale Heart '' , Poe conveys the story from the murderer 's perspective . | Question: where did the cask of amontillado take place ?", "truth": ["Italian city"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-24756", "mistake": "in an unnamed Italian city at carnival time in an unspecified year", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.33333333333333337}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: The Wanderer conveys the meditations of a solitary exile on his past happiness as a member of his lord 's band of retainers , his present hardships and the values of forbearance and faith in the heavenly Lord .

The pigment , called rhodopsin ( conopsin is found in cone cells ) comprises a large protein called opsin ( situated in the plasma membrane ) , attached to which is a covalently bound prosthetic group : an organic molecule called retinal ( a derivative of vitamin A ) . The retinal exists in the 11 - cis - retinal form when in the dark , and stimulation by light causes its structure to change to all - trans - retinal . This structural change causes an increased affinity for the regulatory protein called transducin ( a type of G protein ) . Upon binding to rhodopsin , the alpha subunit of the G protein replaces a molecule of GDP with a molecule of GTP and becomes activated . This replacement causes the alpha subunit of the G protein to dissociate from the beta and gamma subunits of the G protein . As a result , the alpha subunit is now free to bind to the cGMP phosphodiesterase ( an effector protein ) . The alpha subunit interacts with the inhibitory PDE gamma subunits and prevents them from blocking catalytic sites on the alpha and beta subunits of PDE , leading to the activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase , which hydrolyzes cGMP ( the second messenger ) , breaking it down into 5 ' - GMP . Reduction in cGMP allows the ion channels to close , preventing the influx of positive ions , hyperpolarizing the cell , and stopping the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate ( Kandel et al. , 2000 ) .

The term refers to the Persian priestly caste of Zoroastrianism .

Previously the portion of the river upstream from its confluence with the Green River had been known locally as the `` Grand River '' . The change was opposed by many local residents in Utah and Colorado , and the new name was enforced locally by acts of the state legislatures in both states in the early 1920s .

The carceres took up the angled end of the track , where -- before a race -- the chariots were loaded behind spring - loaded gates .

The poem tells of a king , now identified as King Xuan ( r . 827 -- 782 BC ) of the Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046 -- 771 BC ) , who commanded General Nan Zhong ( \u5357\u4ef2 ) to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the Xianyun . The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 -- 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( \u6210 \u5468 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 -- 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1,400 metres ( 4,600 feet ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in Hancheng , Shaanxi .

This is a translation of the Latin phrase dies Solis . English , like most of the Germanic languages , preserves the original pagan / sun associations of the day . Many other European languages , including all of the Romance languages , have changed its name to the equivalent of `` the Lord 's day '' ( based on Ecclesiastical Latin dies Dominica ) . In both West Germanic and North Germanic mythology the Sun is personified as Sunna / S\u00f3l .   Monday : Old English M\u014dnand\u00e6g ( pronounced ( \u02c8mo\u02d0n\u0251nd\u00e6j ) ) , meaning `` Moon 's day '' . This is equivalent to the Latin name dies lunae .

Tiw ( Norse T\u00fdr ) was a one - handed god associated with single combat and pledges in Norse mythology and also attested prominently in wider Germanic paganism . The name of the day is also related to the Latin name dies Martis , `` Day of Mars '' .   Wednesday : Old English W\u014ddnesd\u00e6g ( pronounced ( \u02c8wo\u02d0dnezd\u00e6j ) ) meaning the day of the Germanic god Woden ( known as \u00d3\u00f0inn among the North Germanic peoples ) , and a prominent god of the Anglo - Saxons ( and other Germanic peoples ) in England until about the seventh century . It is also vaguely related to the Latin counterpartdies Mercurii , `` Day of Mercury '' . The connection between Mercury and Odin is more strained than the other syncretic connections . The usual explanation is that both Wodan and Mercury were considered psychopomps , or guides of souls after death , in their respective mythologies ; both are also associated with poetic and musical inspiration . The Icelandic Mi\u00f0viku , German Mittwoch , Low German Middeweek and Finnish keskiviikko all mean mid-week .   Thursday : Old English \u00de\u016bnresd\u00e6g ( pronounced ( \u02c8\u03b8u\u02d0nrezd\u00e6j ) ) , meaning ' \u00deunor 's day ' . \u00deunor means thunder or its personification , the Norse god known in Modern English as Thor . Similarly Dutch donderdag , German Donnerstag ( ' thunder 's day ' ) , Finnish torstai , and Scandinavian Torsdag ( ' Thor 's day ' ) . Thor 's day corresponds to Latin dies Iovis , `` day of Jupiter '' .   Friday : Old English Fr\u012bged\u00e6g ( pronounced ( \u02c8fri\u02d0jed\u00e6j ) ) , meaning the day of the Anglo - Saxon goddess Fr\u00edge . The Norse name for the planet Venus was Friggjarstjarna , ' Frigg 's star ' . It is based on the Latin dies Veneris , `` Day of Venus '' .   Saturday : the only day of the week to retain its Roman origin in English , named after the Roman god Saturn associated with the Titan Cronus , father of Zeus and many Olympians . Its original Anglo - Saxon rendering was S\u00e6turnesd\u00e6g ( pronounced ( \u02c8s\u00e6turnezd\u00e6j ) ) . In Latin , it was dies Saturni , `` Day of Saturn '' . The Scandinavian L\u00f8rdag / L\u00f6rdag deviates significantly as it has no reference to either the Norse or the Roman pantheon ; it derives from old Norse laugardagr , literally `` washing - day '' . The German Sonnabend ( mainly used in northern and eastern Germany ) and the Low German words S\u00fcnnavend mean `` Sunday Eve '' , the German word Samstag ( mainly used in southern and western Germany ) derives from the name for Shabbat . | Question: where did the days of the week originate from ?", "truth": ["Tiw", "\u00deunor 's day", "sun 's day", "Latin name dies lunae", "Latin phrase dies Solis", "Day of Saturn", "Roman god Saturn", "Tiw 's day", "Moon 's day", "Thor", "\u00d3\u00f0inn", "Fr\u00edge"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-54223", "mistake": "Sunday : Old English Sunnand\u00e6g ( pronounced ( \u02c8sunn\u0251nd\u00e6j ) ), meaning `` sun's day ''", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.16666666666666666}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: The eleventh season of the American television sitcom The Big Bang Theory premiered on CBS on Monday , September 25 , 2017 .

Also on this trail , unlike the Oregon trail , there was a serious danger of Native American attacks , for neither the Comanches nor the Apaches of the southern high plains tolerated trespassers . In 1825 , Congress voted for federal protection for the Santa Fe Trail , even though much of it lay in the Mexican territory . Lack of food and water also made the trail very risky . Weather conditions , like huge lightning storms , gave the travelers even more difficulty . If a storm developed , there was often no place to take shelter and the livestock could get spooked . Rattlesnakes often posed a threat , and many people died due to snakebite . The caravan size increased later on to prevent Native American raids .

While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic , their alloy ZrZn 2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K. Cadmium is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys , due to a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance .

For example , such amalgams are known with gold , zinc , sodium , and many other metals . Because iron is an exception , iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury . Other metals that do not form amalgams with mercury include tantalum , tungsten and platinum . Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis , and is also used in high - pressure sodium lamps . Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury - aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact .

When creating the character , screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite . Wasikowska read Carroll 's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role . She also watched Jan \u0160vankmajer 's Alice . She said , `` When we were kids , my mum would pop it in the VCR player . We would be disturbed , and would n't really understand it , but we could n't look away because it was too intriguing . So I had kept that feeling about Alice , a kind of haunting feeling . '' Although facing pressures to conform to society 's expectations , Alice grows into a stronger - willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path ; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls , describing the character as `` stubborn , brave , ( and ) non-girlie '' . Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six - year - old girl .   Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp , The Mad Hatter . Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character .

Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C. Nesbitt character ) reflecting a darker , more dangerous personality . Illusionary dancer David `` Elsewhere '' Bernal doubled for Depp during the `` Futterwacken '' sequence near the end of the film .   Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims , the Red Queen . She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters : the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts . Her first name is a play on the word irascible because she is easily irritated , obstreperous , impatient , and quick to anger . Bonham Carter 's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen . The character hates animals , and chooses to use them as servants and furniture .

He believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting . Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of France because it used unusual French names for cloud types . His system of nomenclature included twelve categories of clouds , with such names as ( translated from French ) hazy clouds , dappled clouds and broom - like clouds . By contrast , Howard used universally accepted Latin , which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803 . As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme , the German dramatist and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe composed four poems about clouds , dedicating them to Howard . An elaboration of Howard 's system was eventually formally adopted by the International Meteorological Conference in 1891 . This system covered only the tropospheric cloud types , but the discovery of clouds above the troposphere during the late 19th . century eventually led to the creation separate classification schemes for these very high clouds . | Question: who developed the classifications we use for clouds ?", "truth": ["Jean - Baptiste Lamarck", "Luke Howard"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-34542", "mistake": "Luke Howard in England and Jean - Baptiste Lamarck in France", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.4615384615384615}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: The Anglo - Saxons were a people who inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century .

The adjective thermohaline derives from thermo - referring to temperature and - haline referring to salt content , factors which together determine the density of sea water . Wind - driven surface currents ( such as the Gulf Stream ) travel polewards from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean , cooling en route , and eventually sinking at high latitudes ( forming North Atlantic Deep Water ) . This dense water then flows into the ocean basins . While the bulk of it upwells in the Southern Ocean , the oldest waters ( with a transit time of around 1000 years ) upwell in the North Pacific .

The Kingdom of Humanity is established .   1876 -- China makes its earliest documented claim to the Paracel Islands   1883 -- When the Spratlys and Paracels were surveyed by Germany in 1883 , China issued protests .   1884 -- 1885 Sino - French War . In December 1884 , alarmed by Japanese ambitions in Korea , Empress Dowager Cixi ordered her ministers to extricate China from the undeclared war with France that had broken out on 23 August . Important French victories in Tonkin and Formosa in February and early March 1885 strengthened her desire to end the Sino - French War , and although the Chinese won an unexpected victory in Tonkin in late March , defeating General de N\u00e9grier 's 2nd Brigade at Bang Bo and reoccupying Lang Son , this success was counterbalanced by the simultaneous French capture of the Pescadores Islands . China 's position in early April 1885 was critical . Seizing the opportunity offered by the fall of the Ferry ministry , the Chinese agreed to implement the provisions of the May 1884 Tientsin Accord , which recognised France 's protectorate over Vietnam . In return , the French dropped their longstanding demand for an indemnity for the Bac Le Ambush . After a flurry of negotiations in Paris in the first days of April 1885 , peace was made on this basis .   11 May 1884 - The Tientsin Accord or Li -- Fournier Convention , concluded on 11 May 1884 , was intended to settle an undeclared war between France and China over the sovereignty of Tonkin ( northern Vietnam ) . The convention , negotiated by Li Hung - chang for China and capitaine de vaisseau Fran\u00e7ois - Ernest Fournier for France , provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam .   9 June 1885 - The Treaty of Tientsin , signed on 9 June 1885 , officially ended the Sino - French War . The unequal treaty restated in greater detail the main provisions of the Tientsin Accord , signed between France and China on 11 May 1884 . As Article 2 required China to recognise the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin established by the Treaty of Hue in June 1884 , implicitly abandoning her own claims to suzerainty over Vietnam , the treaty formalised France 's victory in the Sino - French War .   1887 -- In the 19th century , Europeans found that Chinese fishermen from Hainan annually visited the Spratly islands for part of the year , while in 1877 it was the British who launched the first modern legal claims to the Spratlys .   1887 -- The Convention Respecting the Delimitation of the Frontier Between China and Tonkin between France and the Qing Empire set the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Tonkin . The 1887 Chinese - Vietnamese Boundary convention signed between France and China after the Sino - French War said that China was the owner of the Spratly and Paracel islands . The 1887 Convention Respecting the Delimitation of the Frontier Between China and Tonkin between France and the Qing Empire set the coastal boundary in the Gulf of Tonkin but did not state that China was the owner of the Spratly and Paracel islands because these islands are not in the Gulf of Tonkin nor was administered by Tonkin but belonged to the realm of Annam in Central Vietnam . The purpose of this treaty was for a better control of the border by having it follow the Ka Long river in M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i coastal city , but doing so , the French gave an enclave to China of 7 Vietnamese fishermen 's villages .

The original participating unions were Western Province , Griqualand West , Transvaal and Eastern Province . The first tournament was held in Kimberley and was won by Western Province . For a prize they received a silver cup donated by the South African Rugby Board , now displayed at the SA Rugby Museum in Cape Town . The story of how the Currie Cup came to be comes from the first overseas rugby team to tour South Africa in 1891 , The British Isles , who carried with them a particularly precious bit of cargo . Among the bags , boots and balls was a golden cup given to them by Sir Donald Currie , owner of Union - Castle Lines , the shipping company that transported them to the southern tip of Africa . Sir Donald was clear with his instructions -- hand this trophy over to the team in South Africa that gives you the best game ; and after a spirited display where the unbeaten British Lions narrowly won 3 - 0 , Griqualand West became the first ever holders of the Currie Cup .

This line stretches from the hip joint ( or more precisely the head of the femur ) , through the knee joint ( the intercondylar eminence of the tibia ) , and down to the center of the ankle ( the ankle mortise , the fork - like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli ) . In the tibial shaft , the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide , but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6 \u00b0 , resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174 \u00b0 in a leg with normal axial alignment . A leg is considered straight when , with the feet brought together , both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching . Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis ( intermalleolar distance exceeds 3 cm ) , and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis ( intercondylar distance exceeds 5 cm ) . These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh 's adductors and abductors . The angle of inclination formed between the neck and shaft of the femur , ( collodiaphysial angle ) , varies with age -- about 150 \u00b0 in the newborn , it gradually decreases to 126 - 128 \u00b0 in adults , to reach 120 \u00b0 in old age . Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg : A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga ; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum . Additionally , a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle , the torsion angle , which makes it possible for flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head . Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward ; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility . | Question: what is the joint at the top of the leg called ?", "truth": ["hip joint ( or more precisely the head of the femur )"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-71370", "mistake": "hip joint", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.4}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: Located on the Niagara River , which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario , the combined falls form the highest flow rate of any waterfall in the world that has a vertical drop of more than 165 feet ( 50 m ) .

A thermoconforming organism , by contrast , simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature , thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation . The internal thermoreegulation process is one aspect of homeostasis : a state of dynamic stability in an organism 's internal conditions , maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment ( the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology ) . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 \u00b0 C ( 131 \u00b0 F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 \u00b0 C ( 167 \u00b0 F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 \u00b0 C ( 95 \u00b0 F ) for six hours .

It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it .

Jerome 's decision to use a Hebrew text instead of the previous translated Septuagint went against the advice of most other Christians , including Augustine , who thought the Septuagint inspired .

The most recent perfect game was thrown on August 15 , 2012 , by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners . There were three perfect games in 2012 ; the only other year of the modern era in which as many as two were thrown was 2010 . By contrast , there have been spans of 23 and 33 consecutive seasons in which not a single perfect game was thrown . Though two perfect - game bids have gone into extra innings , no extra-inning game has ever been completed to perfection . | Question: how many perfect games have there been in major league history ?", "truth": ["23 official perfect games"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-78761", "mistake": "23", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.4}, "init_status": "error"}, {"input": "Context: The Spanish -- American War ( Spanish : Guerra hispano - americana or Guerra hispano - estadounidense ; Filipino : Digmaang Espanyol - Amerikano ) was fought between the United States and Spain in 1898 .

Prominent Loyalists repeatedly assured the British government that many thousands of loyalists would spring to arms and fight for the crown .
